He starred in commercials for TruMoo, Universal Orlando, and Volcano Bay as a child. However, he got bitten by the acting bug only when doing the role of Vinnie as a series regular on the Nickelodeon show Talia in the Kitchen. In 2018, he played&nbsp;Kevin Ryan in the film Bernie the Dolphin and did a supporting role of Jake in the fourth season of Stranger Things. His biggest role to date has to be Netflix’s new series, <a href=#>Sweet Magnolias</a>. He joined the show while still in high school. Let’s talk more about it and his life in general in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Actor Logan Plays Kyle Townsend On Sweet Magnolias</strong></h3><p>Sweet Magnolias is about Maddie Townsend (played by JoAnna Garcia Swisher). She is someone with three kids and is in the middle of a divorce. And so,&nbsp;Sweet Magnolias is situated around her and her two lifelong friends dealing with all the conflict in their small town. Actor Logan plays the same Maddie’s&nbsp;youngest son, Kyle Townsend.</p><p>Logan’s character is passionate about musicals, making it difficult to bond with his sports-loving father and brother. Kyle is the nicest kid ever and has a huge heart. Also because he is an actor himself, Logan said he could connect with him on another level.</p><p>What also drew Logan to the project was the fact that he loved its story being based on a book series. He found it “cooler” to portray the character that was already established in a book series.</p><p>Because Talia in the Kitchen&nbsp;was his first-ever show/film (he was only ten years old then), he learned all the basics of the function of a set during that time. He understood everything from marks to cameras to lighting to cheating toward the camera, etc. And all of that, he said made it easier, acting-wise, on the set of Sweet Magnolias.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Actor Logan Allen’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Actor Logan Allen reportedly had nearly $150K net worth as of 2023.</p><p>He started out doing commercials and photo shoots. It was fun for the time being but he was not passionate about it at the time. It really started when he got his first show (Talia in the Kitchen) in 2015. A few scenes in, he knew that is what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.</p><p>As of May 2020, Logan was done attending Harmony Community School and was enrolled in an online high school for the flexibility it afforded his schedule.</p><p>Fast forward to 2023, he continued to be booked by his agent Sharron Elkabas.</p><h3><strong>Actor Logan Allen’s Age</strong></h3><p>Actor Logan Allen was born in 2004. So, he reached the age of 19 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Actor Logan Allen’s Family</strong></h3><p>Actor Logan’s family has been the biggest influence on just in his career but in his life in general. He says, his parents “mainly” have been so supportive. Without them, he believes he would not be where he is now. “The main thing people need to understand is if you want to make it, you need to surround yourself with people who want to see you succeed. That’s the most important thing to do if you want to achieve your dreams. You don’t want people dragging you down”, he has said things like this, every time he was asked to tell about his friends and family.</p><p>Logan’s mom, <a href=#>Melinda Allen</a>, is a teacher and it’s her who gave him the idea that he could be interested in acting. Yet, she was also concerned for him that nobody in the family was in the business.</p><p>On his YouTube channel in May 2022, Logan invited people to join him and his mom as they go to the Queen’s Zoo and the premiere of Stranger Things 4.</p><p>As per her Facebook, Melinda still seemed to be married to Logan’s dad, Todd Allen. The two seemed to be living in their home in <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Kissimmee, Florida as of 2023.</span></p><p>In his family, Logan also has three siblings, two brothers, and a sister. Cody Allen can be found on IG @ codytothallen7. He got married to Taylor Toth-Allen on 24 April 2021 and has been living with her in Saint Cloud, Florida ever since. He was a Valencia College student previously. When he and Taylor got engaged in November 2019, Melinda had taken to the internet that Shy, her daughter, is finally getting that sister she has wanted for so long.</p><p>Now, finally, the youngest in the family is Caleb. He turned 13 on 23 October 2022.</p><p>You should also know that Logan is very much fond of his grandmother Patty Reynolds and his aunt Judy Reynolds Martin.</p><h3><strong>Actor Logan Allen’s Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Logan Allen most likely did not have any girlfriends as of July 2023. Or maybe he just did not want to talk about it in public.</p><h3><strong>Actor Logan Allen Height</strong></h3><p>Actor Logan Allen’s height was 5′ 5″ in 2022.
