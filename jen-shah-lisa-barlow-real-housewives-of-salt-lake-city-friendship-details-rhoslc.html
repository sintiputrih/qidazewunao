<strong><a href=#>Real Housewives</a></strong> fashion, drama and controversy erupted and created a riff between them. What started off as a very close, supportive friendship has turned into one that is overshadowed with doubt and suspicion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout her time on the show, Shah caused friction with other members, but Barlow always seemed to have her back. Even when Jen was handcuffed and arrested in front of the cast, Lisa was the only one who stood by her side and showed her support. As<a href=#> the story behind Jen's legal issues </a>continued to develop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tension grew between the ladies,</a> and their relationship became downright explosive.</p><h2 id=jen-shah-and-lisa-barlow-were-truly-close-friends><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jen Shah And Lisa Barlow Were Truly Close Friends</span></h2><p>There was a time that Jen and Lisa were absolutely inseparable. The ladies were always seen spending time with one another and were consistently supportive of each other's pursuits. Their relationship seemed to be effortless and genuine, and their bond was a strong one. Even when Jen's personality began to irritate others around her, Lisa saw the very best in her friend and continued to invest in their friendship. They shared a strong connection that seemed unstoppable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>NeNe Leakes' New Boyfriend, Nyonisela Sioh, Details Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-barlow-embraces-jen-shah-39-s-destructive-personality><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lisa Barlow Embraces Jen Shah's Destructive Personality</span></h2><p>Jen was discovered 'liking' and engaging in homophobic comments online and at one point she even flashed Meredith's son. It seemed that she knew no boundaries when it came to riling up her fans and creating waves with the other ladies. This led to some seriously fractured relationships between Jen and her co-stars, with the exception of Lisa, who seemed to embrace Jen's destructive personality and managed to remain on her good side.</p><h2 id=lisa-barlow-was-a-dedicated-friend><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lisa Barlow Was A Dedicated Friend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the shocking news of Jen Shah's arrest took over the set of the ladies of the Real Housewives, Meredith, Whitney, Mary, Jennie, and Heather took a few steps back and began to question who Jen Shah really was. It was soon revealed that the fraud charges that were pressed against Jen could potentially put her behind bars for 30 years, and this was too much for the ladies to get on board with. They distanced themselves immediately, leaving Lisa to be the only one dedicated to standing by Jen in her time of need.</p><h2 id=lisa-barlow-proved-her-alliance-after-a-trip-goes-wrong><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lisa Barlow Proved Her Alliance After A Trip Goes Wrong</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During The Real Housewives Of Salt Lake City season 1, Lisa Barlow once again showed her support for Jen Shah. She backed her up after what was one of the most explosive scenes that was ever seen on the program. The drama unfolded during a trip to Las Vegas, when Jen pushed to have everyone turn against Whitney, only to see the scenario backfire on her, leaving the rest of the cast members viewing her with scorn and distrust. Heather declared that she needed a break from Jen's explosive personality, and the rest of the women followed suit. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa proved her alliance</a> by trying to understand her side of things and remaining by her side.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'RHOA' Star, Kandi Burruss And Todd Tucker's Marriage Ups And Downs, Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-barlow-becomes-jen-shah-39-s-only-source-of-support><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lisa Barlow Becomes Jen Shah's Only Source Of Support</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Barlow faced a whole lot of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> backlash from Heather Gay and Meredith Marks</a> for continuing to defend Jen's actions, and it was evident that she was the only source of support that Jen had during her troubling criminal case. Jen Shah was understandably going through a myriad of emotions as the reality of the charges against her began to set in and continued to trust in Lisa for guidance and emotional support. The other cast members had already passed judgement and turned their backs on Shah, but <a href=#>Lisa Barlow remained steadfast in her support of her friend.</a></p><h2 id=jen-shah-feels-lisa-barlow-abandoned-her><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jen Shah Feels Lisa Barlow Abandoned Her</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the reality of Jen Shah's criminal charges continued to unfold, she attempted to reach Lisa Barlow and wasn't getting a response. Her previously rock-solid friendship was beginning to show signs of cracking, and episodes that aired the week before Christmas 2021 depicted the distance that was growing between them.</p><p>Jen outpoured her emotions to her husband, saying, âWhen I got my new phone, I reached out to Lisa, And I called her four or five times. I didnât hear from her." She went on to say, "You donât have to agree with me, you donât have to know the facts, you donât have to know anything. If you care about me, you would be like, âJen, are you OK?ââ</p><h2 id=jen-shah-breaks-down-in-tears-wishing-for-lisa-barlow-39-s-support><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jen Shah Breaks Down In Tears Wishing For Lisa Barlow's Support</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jen Shah and Lisa Barlow's friendship was visibly crumbling, and it was apparent that Jen had really counted on Lisa to help her overcome her troubled times. She was feeling let down and was surprised to see Heather Gay reach out to her to see how she was holding up.</p><p>This further highlighted the fact that Lisa was no longer there to take on that role, and Jen burst into tears on the show, wishing and longing for Lisa's support. âPeople say theyâre ride or die. Youâre not ride or die,â she expressed. âThis is when you show up. Itâs easy for everyone to be there when everythingâs great.
