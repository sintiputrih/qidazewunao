Dippel later became the palace's most infamous occupant and was said to be an eccentric scientist obsessed with outrageous alchemy.</p><p>He allegedly conducted gruesome experiments using animal carcasses. But, more macabrely, he also allegedly used human body parts that were stolen from the corpses of the nearby cemetery of Nieder-Beerbach. He also created a mysterious concoction dubbed "Dippel's Oil," which was a distillation of blood, leather, horns, and ivory that he proclaimed to be the "elixir of life" that could cure any ailment.</p><p>Dippel's antics allegedly upset the local mayor, who spread rumors that Dippel was the blood brother of the devil and that he was trying to create some kind of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">virgin-preying monster</a> in his castle's laboratory. Does this story sound familiar? It should — because that's a more macabre telling of Shelley's legend of Frankenstein's monster.</p><p>It's believed that the Brothers Grimm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Shelley's stepmother about Dippel's insane background, which is where she may have gotten the idea for the story in the first place. Shelley herself traveled to the German region in 1814, four years before her novel's debut.</p><p>But the haunted history of the castle may be more than just fairytales. It's said the forest around the castle is a popular site for witch gatherings in Germany, and that witches frequent the remote area to drink from the magic "fountain of youth" located on the property.</p><p>Castle Frankenstein comes alive every year during Halloween when the monstrous estate is transformed into a real-life haunted house, as actors playing ghosts and goblins wander about for what is considered the largest Halloween bash in the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyprdSnq56cXZiutMDLnqpoaw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./170627-sister-sister-update-hit-shows-cast-20-y-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Sister, Sister:' Update on Hit Show's Cast 20 Years after it Ended</a>
