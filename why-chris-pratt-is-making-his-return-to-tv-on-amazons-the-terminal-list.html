From his humble beginnings performing as a stripper (<a href=#>wonder how much money Mr. Pratt made as a dancer? Click to find out</a>), before he became famous on the small screen as Andy Dwyer on Parks and Recreation, to his casting within the MCU juggernaut as Star Lord, Pratt has become one of the most recognizable faces on the big screen and a franchise superstar. Of course, Pratt is not beyond the occasional controversy, such as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his association with the Hillsong Church (which he has denied</a>) and even comedian extraordinaire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendan Schaub criticizing Pratt for comments made after viewing UFC 276 main event</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Jennifer Lawrence Had Something To Do With Anna Faris And Chris Pratt's Divorce</a></span></p><p>Despite the aforementioned bumps in the road, the man has reached the very top of the entertainment mountain, while also finding himself married with children (with wife Katherine Schwarzenegger.<a href=#> Who is she? Click and find out</a>). So, why, then, has the Guardians of the Galaxy star decided to venture back to the small screen? Why ask me? Right, I wrote this. Sorry about that. Let’s do this work, folks.</p><h2 id=pratt-rsquo-s-breakout-role-was-on-parks-and-recreation><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Pratt’s Breakout role Was On Parks And Recreation</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pratt’s first TV forays came on shows such as The Huntress, playing Harold Abbott on the series Everwood, and a regular role on The O.C. However, it was his casting on the 2009 hit sitcom<strong> </strong>Parks and Recreation<strong> </strong>that was the Jurassic World star’s breakout role.<a href=#> While his behavior on the show was seriously wrong</a>, his casting on the show was undoubtedly one of the factors that made the series a hit. Fun fact: Parks and Recreation was originally meant to be a spinoff of TheOffice.</p><h2 id=pratt-successfully-transitioned-to-the-big-screen-after-leaving-the-show><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pratt Successfully Transitioned To The Big Screen After Leaving The Show</span></h2><p>Let’s be honest, when it comes to the success of actors transitioning from small to big screen, the rate is not that high. However,<strong> </strong>Chris Pratt was one of the fortunate actors that managed to<strong> </strong>break large on the big screen. To be fair, Pratt had been bouncing back and forth from TV to film for a while, but it wasn't until his casting as Star Lord that he would see true success on film (that’s putting it mildly as the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, well, the Marvel Cinematic Universe).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Pratt Once Dated His TV Sister</a></span></p><h2 id=pratt-is-set-to-add-another-big-time-franchise-to-his-list-of-work><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Pratt Is Set To Add Another Big Time Franchise To His List Of Work</span></h2><p>Landing a role in a major franchise is rare enough for an actor. Some may never achieve such a career milestone. However, in Pratt’s case, The Lego Movie star has managed to find himself in the aforementioned MCU, the Jurassic franchise, and soon a beloved video game franchise Super Mario<strong>. </strong>Pratt is set to lend his voice to the Italian super plumber from Brooklyn in a yet to be titled animated Mario film. It’s-A-Pratt, Mario (did that land? I feel it landed).</p><h2 id=the-terminal-list-is-pratt-39-s-return-to-tv><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Terminal List Is Pratt's Return To TV</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a move that usually signifies the end of an actor’s film career,<strong> </strong>Pratt has decided to return to the small screen, albeit on the massive Amazon Prime Video streaming platform. Pratt stars in the new Prime military series<strong> </strong>The Terminal List as James Reece, a Navy SEAL team leader tangled in a deep conspiracy. This is hardly uncharted territory for Pratt, as the Passengers star was featured in the military film Zero Dark Thirty once upon a time. The show itself is based on a novel by former Navy SEAL Jack Carr, who was a sniper before placing the Barrett M82 within the closet and picking up a pen…or laptop, I guess. While the streaming series hasn't been receiving the best of reviews from critics, the show is nonetheless a bona fide success, with speculation that a second season is not out of the question. So, rejoice, fans. You’ll get your Navy SEAL-Pratt fix soon enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Billion Dollar Film Chris Pratt Got Turned Down For Because He Didn't Have The "It" Factor</a></span></p><h2 id=pratt-is-also-the-executive-producer-of-the-terminal-list><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Pratt Is Also The Executive Producer Of The Terminal List</span></h2><p>Oh, the role of executive producer. You know that job, right? That’s the job that guarantees creative control over the project. With that in mind, it’s no wonder why many actors take up the aforementioned position. Chris Pratt is no exception, signing on as an executive producer<strong> </strong>for The Terminal List which gives him creative control of the project.</p><h2 id=his-return-to-tv-has-made-him-the-highest-paid-tv-actor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Return To TV Has Made Him The Highest-Paid TV Actor</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With<strong> </strong>Pratt’s series being picked up by Amazon, the actor’s return to TV sees him becoming the<strong> </strong>highest-paid actor on the small screen, with a<strong> </strong>$1.4 million-per-episode salary. Pratt has also made it known that he has the utmost respect for the men and women who have served and continue to serve in the military, almost making this return to the military genre seemingly a thank you to the military service people or even a passion project. According to cinemablend.com, Pratt would say as much while being interviewed about the series, “I have an affinity for the Navy SEAL community, and for the Spec Ops community. Having played a Navy SEAL in Zero Dark Thirty, and subsequently becoming really close with the guy who I had shadowed on that, who’s now an associate producer on The Terminal List, Jared Shaw, who plays Boozer … it just felt right. He had access to the book, I read the book, I loved the character, I loved the fact that it was shot in California. In Southern California, which is close to home. I knew that he and I would be able to do it together, which was something. We’d been looking for a project to do together. So, we optioned it, we brought it to Amazon, they were on board, and from there an opportunity to sort of team up with my best friend to portray this rowdy bad mother, it was just like win-win.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Chris Pratt Killed Off In 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3' By Marvel Fans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdJmp6uZpKl6qr%2BMppikoZ6ceqm10mapnqylp7tuwM5mq69ln6N6ornAs6anq12ptaZ5056ppqGelrluuMisq2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./15-of-the-strangest-things-the-simpsons-has-predicted.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 of the strangest things The Simpsons has predicted</a>
