Since they started dating the same year they've both done a great job keeping things out of the public eye regardless of how famous Swift is. They've certainly succeeded in making their relationship a topic of speculation for fans who want to know more.</p><p>After Swift's album Reputation, she released Lover, Folklore, and Evermore. These albums gave fans some insight into Swift and Alwyn's relationship. <a href=#>The albums were all packed with songs about falling in love</a>.

The rumors were even more fueled when it was <a href=#>rumored that there were plans for an upcoming private wedding ceremony in 2020.</a> It seems those rumors aren't really true but are not 100% confirmed to be false.</p><p>In an interview just last month, Alwyn commented on the engagement/marriage rumors. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”</a> Alwyn said in an interview.
