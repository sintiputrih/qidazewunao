have generated as much hype surrounding their debut as emerging Bantamweight contender <strong>Raul Rosas Jr.</strong> did during his first appearance in the octagon. After Rosas secured a first-round victory, this hype intensified, attracting even more fans to join his bandwagon. However, many of these fans eventually abandoned ship after Rosas lost a close decision to Christian Rodriguez at UFC 287.</p><p>Now, months after his first defeat in a professional fight, Rosas is poised to make his octagon comeback at UFC’s Fight Night 227 event, better known as UFC Fight Night: Grasso vs. Shevchenko 2. On the event’s main card, Rosas will face fellow bantamweight <strong>Terrence Mitchell</strong>. Going into the event, the New Mexico native will undoubtedly aim to regain his winning momentum, with ambitions reaching beyond just that.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Is Raul Rosas Jr. on his way to break Jon Jones’ 12-year-old record?</h2><p>Making his UFC debut at the age of 18, Raul Rosas Jr. has already achieved a feat only the best in the sport of MMA can claim. However, to establish himself as the cream of the crop, he still needs to capture UFC Gold. Considering his early entry into the promotion, Rosas has a high chance of achieving champion status. In the process, he could also become the youngest champion in UFC history, a record currently held by Jon Jones. As seen during his recent press conference, ‘El Nino Problema’ still holds this ambition, despite the recent loss.</p><p>MMA is undoubtedly a young man’s sport. While experience increases with age, so does the physical toll from years of strenuous training and fighting. Eventually, the body’s limitations may prevent pushing as hard as before. However, youth doesn’t always guarantee an advantage. While younger fighters can recover quickly and push harder, their lack of experience can be detrimental, as seen in Rosas’s recent MMA bout. But some fighters are an exception to this rule, showing tremendous MMA proof at a very young age. And who can be a bigger example of this, than UFC Heavyweight King and consensus GOAT <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jon Jones</a>. Making his UFC debut in 2008, Jones wasn’t initially the polished fighter we know today. However, just three years later, he became the youngest champion in UFC history by defeating Maurício ‘Shogun’ Rua at the main event of UFC 128.</p><p>Fast forward to 2023, with 13 title defenses and titles in two UFC divisions, Jones still holds this distinction. But if Raul Rosas Jr. and his supporters are to be believed, Jon Jones’s days of holding this record are numbered. However, given the unpredictable nature of MMA, it’s too early to give any sort of confirmation, especially when many of these ‘poised to be the next’ claims have been proven to be flukes in the past. From Rory MacDonald being touted as the next <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>GSP</a> to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Johnny Walker</a> being the man to finally beat Jon Jones, the sport has seen its fair share of unexpected twists. Nevertheless, with his well-rounded game, Raul Rosas Jr. brings some serious excitement to his matchups. It will be fascinating to see how his journey unfolds in the coming years.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What’s next for Rosas Jr. after this fight?</h2><p>This weekend, Raul Rosas Jr. is set to face Terrance Mitchell. Entering the fight as a massive -750 favorite, it seems the matchmakers are speculating on Rosas Jr.’s victory. Though nothing could be said for sure, there’s no doubt that Rosas Jr. has a clear advantage over Mitchell. All thanks to his all-round skill set. This, however, raises the question of what’s next for him. Currently unranked in the UFC’s official rankings, a fight with a top-15 opponent would be an ideal way to test the young fighter’s skills.</p><p>Arguably the most competitive division in the promotion, UFC’s 135lb lineup is filled with talent. Thus, a matchup and potential victory against any ranked opponent would undoubtedly testify to Rosas’s potential. As for who he should face next, it’s a matter of debate. With such a stacked division, there’s no shortage of exciting potential matchups, ranging from veterans like Cody Garbrandt to rising prospects like Umar Nurmagomedov. Who will he actually end up fighting? Only time and Dana White can tell.</p><p>Nevertheless, what are your thoughts on this? Can Raul Rosas Jr. break Jon Jones’ record? Let us know in the comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SfmmalnZZ6r7HWrGSiq12nrra4jKumrJmjYrezec6nZKGho2LEosWMraZmmpWYvK6xjK2fnmWppMKvs8Ssq2atlph6pLTApqeip55irq%2BwjJupnpmbYrewuoyjpqedo2LBuLHLr5xmsZWWv267y51kq52TpL%2BledahmK2rXZ67br%2FTqKmeZZakv27Ax55knqGXncGmsc1msGanXZaztbHRZp%2Biq12jsrnAjJ%2BgoKCkZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jollztv-net-worth-age-wiki-biography-relationship-wife-dating-ethnicity-height-facts-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jollztv Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Biography, Relationship, Wife, Dating, Ethnicity,Height&amp;amp;Facts</a>
