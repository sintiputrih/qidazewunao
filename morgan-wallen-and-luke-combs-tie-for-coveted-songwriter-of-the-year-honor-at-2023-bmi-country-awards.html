I think it’s something that gets lost sometimes. As much as we talk about how amazing songwriter are and how integral they are to the craft of creating music… to be able to set a night aside like this and be like, ‘hey, we’re putting a spotlight on the people that wrote these songs;’ shoutout to BMI for doing that because its incredible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EGS09698_L1oFmfsW-scaled.jpg><p>From the moment the ceremony began, all eyes were on <strong>Matraca Berg</strong>, as she earned herself a seat next to an elite group of songwriters who have had an indelible influence on music makers overs generations including <strong><a href=#>Toby Keith</a>, <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a>, <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a>, <a href=#>Merle Haggard</a>, <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a>, Kris Kristofferson, Dean Dillon, <a href=#>Hank Williams, Jr.</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Stevie Nicks</strong></a> with the BMI Icon Award.</p><p><a href=#><b>Lainey Wilson</b></a>&nbsp;performed her own rendition of <a href=#><strong>Deana Carter</strong></a>’s CMA Award-winning classic “Strawberry Wine,” while&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Ashley McBryde</b></a>&nbsp;took to the stage for a gritty performance of Trisha Yearwood’s 1992 hit “Wrong Side of Memphis.”&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Kenny Chesney</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Grace Potter</b></a>&nbsp;closed out the tribute as they reunited for a powerhouse duet of their 3x Platinum award-winning single, “You and Tequila.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/K2_0066_KzNifu8L.jpg><p><b>Luke Combs</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Morgan Wallen</b>&nbsp;tied for the coveted&nbsp;BMI Songwriter of the Year&nbsp;award, as each songwriter co-wrote four of BMI’s most-performed songs in Country music.
