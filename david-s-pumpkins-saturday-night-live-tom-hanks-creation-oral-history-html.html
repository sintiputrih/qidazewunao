Pumpkins’s deal is. The now-classic sketch (more commonly referred to as “David Pumpkins”), starring Tom Hanks as Mr. Pumpkins, was written by similarly confused people trying to figure out what his deal is. The character — his signature wardrobe, orange hair-streak, hand motions, voice, name — became clearer with each step in the SNL process. Exactly one year from the debut of “Haunted Elevator,” and a week away from a new <a href=#>David Pumpkins Halloween special</a>, this is the story of how it came together, told by those who wrote it — Bobby Moynihan, Mikey Day, and Streeter Seidell.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cla2nrv40000q3b6zccp7maq8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Monday</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cx9jn00063k62votdusna@published data-word-count=16>On Monday nights, the writers meet with the host in Lorne Michaels’s office and pitch ideas.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxhc9005j3k62zw1jhbem@published data-word-count=36>Streeter Seidell: Last season was electrifying from the get-go with all the political stuff.

There’s a SWAT team perched at a window doing reconnaissance, and then in the apartment over, Tom and I are dancing.

So we just dropped it and wrote a few other things. We wrote one where he’s Frankenstein that I was working on for a good chunk of the night. It was just Mikey and I alone first, talking about the one that eventually became “SWAT Recon.” Then it was tabled for a few hours, and Bobby came in and they started talking about it and I joined in, and everything changed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxa4q000l3k62vnxbz6i3@published data-word-count=102>MD: Late at night, we were writing, trying to crack a sketch where a couple goes into a haunted house. Different ghouls were going to sing a song, but they were supposed to be scary, like, “I live under the stairs.” Then it could go to three coffins, and we were all three going to be skeletons dancing to the “Holiday Rap” breakdown. We were working on it for a while, but we couldn’t quite crack where it goes after that. We had the first beat, and then we were like, “Okay, we each would come out of a coffin.” Then what?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxa54000m3k624i3np4g6@published data-word-count=27>BM: At one point, after the coffins, we tried it where we would pop out of paintings, out of a clock, and other things in the house.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxa6d000n3k62ku3futvl@published data-word-count=13>MD: We can’t quite figure this out, and it’s around 3:30, 4 a.m.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxa7x000o3k62p2dvo1xd@published data-word-count=45>SS: We’re starting to get that stress, ’cause 7 a.m. is when the Today show&nbsp;warms up outside.

Sometime around then, we have the idea of “Tower of Terror.” I grew up in Orange County near Disneyland. I don’t know if that ride was around when I was a kid, but I’ve been on it a few times. It’s such a good, adaptable ride for a sketch because the doors open and something occurs, then it shuts, and something else happens.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj93cxaba000q3k6214r2yvrr@published data-word-count=18>SS: Our idea was that it was real.

I like it! I can’t really explain why!” And then the people who don’t like it are angry that someone does like it, and it’s making them confused even more.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cla2ok61b000v3b6whk42gw7o@published data-word-count=21>MD: Tom was so chill about it all.
