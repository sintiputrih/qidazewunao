Avoid short driving distances (less than 10 miles) as these drives do not fully charge your batteries.</span></span><h2>How long does it take for a car battery to charge while idling?</h2>You'd likely have to leave your car running for hours to even come close to a full charge. This is due to the amount of charge that is initially lost when cranking the engine. Some studies have shown that it can take between 15-30 minutes to recoup this initial charge.<h2>Will a battery charge while idling?</h2>Assuming the alternator, engine, belt, and battery are all in working order, then yes, a car battery will charge when idling. The only caveat is that it doesn't really “charge” that fast. This is solely due to the fact that the engine doesn't have a load on it when your car is simply idling.<h2>Does revving engine charge battery faster?</h2>The battery will charge faster if you rev the engine faster. Why? Because the faster the crankshaft turns, the faster it turns the belt that runs the alternator. And the faster the alternator turns, the more electricity it produces to run all the electrical stuff in the car — and recharge the battery.<h2>Will a car battery recharge if you let it sit?</h2>If you let the battery rest for awhile, the hydrogen gas dissipates and the battery "comes back to life".
