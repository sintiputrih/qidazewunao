There are tons of people who want to become famous on the platforms and one wrong move can either get you banned, canceled, or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">force you to go into hiding.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenna Marbles knows these pressures because they happened to her. She was accused of having offensive content, including blackface, in past videos, so this past June she uploaded a video on her channel explaining that she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving her millions of subscribers</a> indefinitely.</p><p>Nothing excuses her behavior in those past videos but we still miss her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her channel managed to earn her an $8 million net worth</a> and subsequently allowed her to buy her $3 million home. So while we sit here missing her, let's take a look at her pad.</p><h2 id=she-s-originally-from-rochester-new-york-but-made-the-move-to-california>She's Originally From Rochester, New York But Made The Move To California</h2><p>For most Millenials, Marbles was the person that made their teenaged years bearable. Tuning into her videos every week and watching the hilarious things she did to either herself or her boyfriend made life a little easier. Who else would do a drunk make-up tutorial or make a god awful yet highly catchy song called "Land Shark"?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her videos, she embodied all the weird stuff we thought about as teens. She could even be considered as one of the founding mothers of YouTube and has had a&nbsp;whopping total of 2.6 billion views.</p><p>But as she did more and more outrageous things, her popularity skyrocketed and soon she was making enough money to move from Rochester, New York to Sherman Oaks, California in 2018.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How YouTuber Jake Paul Is Adding To His $17 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Fans found out about the comedian's move when she posted the video " We Bought A House," in which she gives a tour. The video now has 5 million views, so people were very curious to see her new crib.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the video's description, Marbles wrote a "complicated" message about not wanting to seem like she was flaunting her wealth.</p><p>"This house means the world to us," she said. "The absolute world...Also just a clarification about when we are talking about not contributing to the online culture of flaunting your belongings, that's not shade at people. I'm proud for people that do that and I think it's wonderful for them, I love to watch them and I think it's really cool when people are genuine about it because they deserve whatever they want to spend their money on, I just don't have that in me which was what I was trying to express. Like I said I have some "nice things" guilt which is why I don't have a lot of nice things lol, not because I don't think they're nice I just feel weird having nice things, a nice house included. IDK OKAY ITS COMPLICATED."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Celebs With Amazing YouTube Channels (& 5 Who Should Start One)</a></span></p><p>She went on to explain that the new house was their freedom and future and took the time to write that she was thankful for everyone who supports her.</p><p>"I'm looking forward to ruining my future kitchen table with acrylic nail supplies etc. because the salon will live on know what I'm saying," Marbles joked. "Anyways though, we are incredibly happy, and the next time you see us we will be in our new home."</p><h2 id=the-house-is-described-as-a-cap-cod-stunner>The House Is Described As A 'Cap Cod Stunner'</h2><p>The house reportedly sits on a cul-de-sac and was built in 2016. It was flipped and sold to Marbles just two years later. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real estate sites describe it as a "Cap Cod stunner."</a></p><p>But there's nothing Cap Cod-like about the house. It is not low considering its two-story height and has columns in the front entrance. It has gates to keep peeping fans out and a fully functional security system. It even has an enormous front garden fountain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Reason Why Tyler Oakley Is Officially Leaving YouTube</a></span></p><p>Open the doors and you'll find a grand entryway, nice clean white walls, and high ceilings. On the right of the front door is the living room and to the left is a very spacious dining room with a long dark wood dining table under a modern chandelier. The room is lined with huge, almost floor-length windows.</p><p>Underneath the staircase is a temperature-controlled wine room/cellar and straight through is the open kitchen and family room.</p><p>There is a huge grey marble island and tons of grey cabinets and countertops, which Marble may or may not have messed up with nail polish.&nbsp;There's a smaller kitchen table next to the island which leads into the family room.</p><p>The family room has a huge grey marble fireplace, an equally large L-shaped couch, and a glass wall that looks out into the back yard which has a beautiful saltwater pool and BBQ area. Also downstairs is a pantry off of the kitchen and a guest bedroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The house's white and grey color scheme carries all the way upstairs as well. There is a long&nbsp;landing with built-in bookcases which leads to the home's four bedrooms that all have their own ensuite bathrooms.</p><p>Marbles' master suite has a grey marble fireplace that matches the one downstairs and the kitchen's island. The room also has a balcony to the backyard, huge walk-in closets, and a luxurious ensuite bathroom with dual vanities.</p><p>You can see the whole house tour in Marbles video, but one thing is for sure. The house is pretty nice, and Marbles deserved it. Let's just hope that she didn't do anything stupid to it during her drunk make-up tutorials.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Perez Hilton Blames Conservative YouTuber For His New Social Media Ban</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaelnqurdGbo56rXa68tsDUm5yrZZikwrSxjGxkpqGcobawuo4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./aly-goni-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Aly Goni (Bigg Boss 14) Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a>
