It’s delicious, comforting, and completely ironic. You won’t find any “mac” here, and you won’t find any “cheese.” What you will&nbsp;find is a whole bunch of cauliflower coated in a gooey, oozy vegan cheese sauce and baked with crispy panko breadcrumbs on top. If you’re skeptical, don’t be. This cauliflower mac and cheese is surprisingly addictive. The first time I made it, I served myself a small scoop. A few minutes later, I went back for another…and another…and another. Of course, it’s not exactly like classic…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>French onion soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. For years, I hadn’t been able to find a good vegetarian version of it, because it’s traditionally made with beef broth. But since caramelized onions are what make it so flavorful, it seemed like a prime candidate for a meat-free makeover. After lots of testing (and lots of soup), I’m here to tell you that this French onion soup recipe is just as good as any made with beef stock. Swimming with velvety caramelized onions, it’s bold, savory, and delicious. To make it, I turn to my go-to ingredients for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you love creamy pasta that 1) tastes great and 2) makes you feel great, then you need this vegan Alfredo sauce in your life. It’s just as silky and rich as the classic kind, but it’s made with 100% plant-based ingredients. Nutritional yeast adds cheesy flavor, and lemon juice brightens it up. And instead of cheese, cream, or butter (or even vegan butter!), a secret ingredient gives it its ultra-creamy texture. Any guesses? It’s…cauliflower! If you’ve been following the blog for a while, you’re probably not surprised. I love blending this versatile veggie into creamy sauces that are smooth…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I am OBSESSED with these vegan brownies! They’re chewy, gooey, and rich – everything you want a brownie to be. The edges are crisp and the middles are fudgy. Tasting them, you’d never guess that they’re made without eggs or butter. I’ve developed a vegan brownie recipe before (see the Vegan Date Brownies on page 245 of Love & Lemons Every Day!). That recipe was on the healthy side – I sweetened it naturally with Medjool dates and maple syrup, and I used oat flour to make it gluten-free.

Powdered sugar isn’t something I use often, but every once in a while, I need a cup to make perfect gooey brownies or luscious cream cheese frosting. When I add it to the grocery list, I dread watching another bag sit in the cupboard as I make my way through it at an agonizing pace. But all that’s about to change! I don’t know what took me so long, but I&nbsp;finally learned how to make powdered sugar at home.

He’s the biggest cheese lover I know, but he would happily eat 2 (erm, 3…) of these vegan quesadillas and still go back for more. While this vegan quesadilla recipe includes vegan cheese, we really love it because of the fresh veggie filling. Spicy poblanos play off caramelized roasted sweet potatoes, and diced bell peppers add a delicious crunch. Served with all the fixings, it’s super flavorful and fun. Try it for a quick and easy dinner or a healthy game day snack!

With all the recipe testing that goes on in our kitchen, I hadn’t gotten around to it. But that day, a trip to the grocery store was totally out of the question. Six inches of snow had already accumulated outside, and six more were on their way. It seemed like the perfect time to cozy up in the kitchen and cook black beans from scratch. Black beans are an ingredient that I use all the time.

We’re not big football fans, but it wouldn’t be Super Bowl Sunday without Super Bowl snacks, right? If you’re watching the game on Sunday (or even if you’re not!), I hope you’ll try this recipe. I top a bed of crispy French fries with smoky plant-based chili and generous drizzles of vegan cheese. Yep, that’s right! These chili cheese fries are totally vegan. But more importantly, they’re tasty, satisfying, and really darn fun.

Instead, the blended cauliflower creates its luscious texture—no dairy required! I’ve had this cauliflower soup recipe in my cold weather rotation for years now. Even though all the ingredients are plant-based, it’s just as comforting as any soup made with heavy cream, milk, or cheese. On a chilly winter night, it absolutely hits the spot! It’s also super simple to make, so there’s lots to love here.

Over the last few days, a big, blustery snowstorm has turned Chicago into a winter wonderland. When Jack and I come inside from a chilly walk or shoveling snow, a hot bowl of tortellini soup is the perfect way to warm up. If you’re also craving cozy, nourishing meals right now, you’ll love this tortellini soup recipe.

I especially love making it in the winter, when basil is out of season. Of course, it doesn’t taste exactly like basil pesto (basil is more aromatic, while kale is more peppery), but it’s still delicious. Extra-virgin olive oil and pepitas make it rich and nutty, and lemon juice adds a lovely bright finish. The whole recipe requires 8 ingredients and comes together in 5 minutes, so it’s a great one to have in your back pocket.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzErGapmZeafHWAjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./peregrine-pearson-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Peregrine Pearson Net Worth: How Much is He Worth?</a>
