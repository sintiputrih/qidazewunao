Models.</p><p>Kendall's first modeling job was for Forever 21 but by 2013 she transitioned to high fashion after signing with Society Management and landed covers for Miss Vogue Australia and Harper's Bazaar Arabia.</p><p>Soon after her 18th birthday, she made her runway debut for Marc Jacobs, which was quickly followed by runway appearances for Chanel, Balmain, and Tommy Hilfiger.</p><p>Kendall has gone on to become one of the most in-demand and highest-earnings models, but it wasn't always easy for her.</p><p>"There was a long period of time, I'd say the core five years of it, that I was extremely overworked," she said on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">On Purpose podcast.</a></p><p>"Not my happiest – not because I wasn't doing what I loved, but just because I was
