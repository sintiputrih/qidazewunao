Palisades pad</h4><p>Following his divorce with actress Missy McKnight, the former Friends star bought the house in late 2007 for $7.4 million (£5.2 million).</p><p>LeBlanc subsequently sold the house for just under $8.8 million (£6.2 million), profiting handsomely on his investment.</p><p>When the actor was filming several television episodes in London in 2012, he rented out the 1930s Spanish-style mansion unfurnished for a reported $12,995 (£9k) per month.</p><p>The two-story property has approximately 4,000 square feet of interior space, has a typical stucco façade with a red-tiled roof and vaulted ceilings, exposed timber beams, ironwork, original hardwood floors, fireplaces, and beautiful tile work.</p><p>There are four bathrooms and four bedrooms and expansive and dramatic public areas designed to entertain.</p><p>In addition, the house includes a cook’s kitchen, where the actor is sure to have prepared several Joey-inspired Italian feasts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Matt-Leblancs-house.jpg><p>The home’s half-acre tree-filled yard features sweeping lawns, lovely fountains, and peaceful lounging areas with hammocks.</p><p>There’s also a big curving road and a garage in front of the house, where LeBlanc, not sure, kept all of his favorite toys.</p><h4>Encino Home</h4><p>He paid close to the $3.5 million asking price for a 2-acre hilltop property in Encino, including furniture.</p><p>He purchased a gated community with views of the San Fernando Valley.</p><p>The principal residence is 7,000 square feet and features four bedrooms, a media room, billiard room.</p><p>It also has a 250-gallon saltwater aquarium and wine-tasting area with 2,000 bottle storage in a former bank vault.</p><p>The residence was designed and built by the seller, an electronics expert, over four years.</p><p>A tennis court cantilevers over a 200-foot-long driveway on the property’s grounds.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Now it’s time to explore what LeBlanc has in his garage in terms of automobiles.</p><p>The actor likes a good time behind the wheel as much as he enjoys strolling down the red carpet.</p><p>Even if he doesn’t possess enough cars to drive one for each day of the month, the man has his tastes, and many of you will appreciate them.</p><h4>Ford Focus RS</h4><p>With a long history in motorsport, the RS moniker is something that every Ford owner wants on their vehicle.</p><p>Primarily when it’s shaped like a new Focus and painted in Nitrous Blue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matt-leblanc-carl.jpg><p>The 2018 Ford Focus RS seems like some good fun at an affordable price, with a starting MSRP of $36,995 and a 350 horsepower 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder lump.</p><h4>Porsche 911 R</h4><p>The 911 R was initially priced at $184,900, over $10,000 more than the 911 GT3 RS.</p><p>Moreover, the wingless GT3 is now worth between $350,000 and $400,000, which is astounding.</p><p>The 911 R is a genuine sleeper in terms of design, as it shares the same body and most exterior elements as the 991-generation 911 GT3 RS.</p><p>However, the 911 R, unlike the GT3 RS, has a bare Carrera-style rear end that lacks the large back wing.</p><h4>Porsche 911 GT2 RS</h4><p>The 911 GT2 RS is widely regarded as one of the best modern Porsches, with 620 horsepower, loads of aero, and a dynamic attitude.</p><p>LeBlanc owns one, which he adores and claims can be rather exhilarating when pushed to its limits.</p><p>Only 30 units will be produced, with six going to the United States, with prices starting at $620,000.</p><p>This limited-edition 911 GT2 RS Clubsport 25 honors Porsche and Manthey-25-year Racing’s motorsports partnership.</p><h4>Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe</h4><p>There’s no better way to flaunt your financial prowess than with a Rolls-Royce.</p><p>The Phantom Drophead Coupe, on the other hand, is the way to go if you want to feel the wind in your hair while not looking like a stodgy British lord.</p><p>The Phantom is the most costly Rolls-Royce, with prices starting at moreover $450,000.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG</h4><p>Sometimes you’ll need a vehicle with a bit of extra cargo space, but for most people, it means sacrificing performance.</p><p>When you’re a celebrity with a net worth of $80 million like Matt LeBlanc, you can obtain not only a sexy SUV but also one with a plethora of opulent extras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/matt-leblanc-car.jpg><p>It’s no surprise that the man has a Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG in his collection because it’s both practical and exciting.</p><p>The Mercedes-Benz M-pricing Class’s range varies depending on the trim level you select.</p><p>The model’s price ranges from $35,700 to $119,350, depending on the year it was made.</p><h4>Ferrari 458 Italia</h4><p>LeBlanc felt he needed a Ferrari upgrade after getting a taste of the 360 Modena.</p><p>Never mind that he spent three years on Top Gear driving the most remarkable automobiles.</p><p>His need for speed is genuine, which is why he purchased the Ferrari 458 Italia, which has a 0-60 mph time of fewer than three seconds.</p><h4>CAT D6M XL Bulldozer</h4><p>No, even if LeBlanc gets an icy stare in his eyes when he gets behind the wheel, this isn’t how he subdues obstinate automobiles.</p><p>Instead, while this isn’t his regular driver, he uses it to eke out dirt paths on his California ranch.</p><p>Because the man is not just a vehicle enthusiast but also a motorcycle enthusiast, with Ducatis and Aprilias in his garage, that, however, is a story for another day.</p><h2>Matt LeBlanc: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Matt LeBlanc maintains his fitness by eating healthy and exercising consistently.</p><p>The actor, who has been in the entertainment industry for decades, understands the need for self-care.</p><p>He has always had an active lifestyle, going to the gym, participating in sports, and spending time outside.</p><p>“I work out every day, I run, and I’m as fit as a horse,” the actor explained.</p><p>He also attributes his muscular arms and overall strength to weight training.</p><p>We were a little enamored when Matt LeBlanc was first on TV screens in 1994’s first Friends series as the fresh-faced, dim-witted Joey Tribbiani.</p><p>He has demonstrated that he’s capable of doing something that so many celebrities struggle with: gracefully aging.</p><p>Even as he approaches his 50th birthday, his allure remains undiminished.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>According to Camilla Long of the London Sunday Times, Matt LeBlanc is proud of his five-year unemployment.</p><p>On Friends, LeBlanc made $100 million over a decade as the dimwitted skirt-chaser Joey; at the end, he and the other cast members were being paid $1.3 million each episode.</p><p>According to him, the money he made from Friends and its spin-off, Joey, “totally transformed my life, my daughter’s life, and my grandchild’s life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Matt-Leblancs-vacation.jpg><p>He bought a ranch for his mother and spent time with his family and doing activities he enjoyed, none of which included going to a studio to produce TV series.</p><p>In truth, after Joey ended, LeBlanc took a five-year hiatus, partially due to a divorce and partly due to his commitment to his little daughter.</p><p>The latter was born with severe neurological disease.</p><p>She’s fine now, but he’s so attached to her that he doesn’t want to have any more children for fear of upsetting her.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>Meg Ryan’s Net Worth: Career & Lifestyle.</a></strong></p><h2>F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Post- Friends,
