Before their famous father, OJ Simpson, became an NFL football player, and met and married their mother Nicole Brown, OJ was previously married to his first wife, Marguerite Simpson. In <strong>OJ's first marriage, they had three children together; Arnelle Simpson, Jason Simpson, and Aaren Simpson</strong>.

OJ moved on with his life and married Nicole Brown, but their union ended up in divorce as well, filed by Nicole on the claims of irreconcilable differences.</p><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong><strong> On April 11th, 2024, it was reported that OJ Simpson died at the age of 76 after a long battle with Cancer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His family posted the news on social media</a>.</strong></p><h2 id=how-was-life-for-sydney-brooke-simpson-growing-up>How Was Life For Sydney Brooke Simpson Growing Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usatsi_3356156.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sydney grew up in the limelight due to her association with her famous father OJ Simpson, who was recognized nationwide as being a famous football player and actor.

One person left a comment concerning the book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OJ wrote titled, 'If I Did It' </a>and said, "I'm fascinated that anyone is actually still debating this. OJ effectively confessed when he wrote his book, under the paper-thin cover of writing it as a hypothetical. No sane person if they'd been falsely accused of a m***** would then write an account of how he committed a crime and say, ' No, not really.' If it wasn't already obvious that OJ committed the m*****, this confession should remove all doubts. The only way to come away with the alternate conclusion is if you really, really, wanted to believe it."</p><p>Another one went on to say, "I mean, just look at the cover of the book. Does anyone think it's an accident that 'I DID IT' is printed in highly visible red font whereas 'IF' is printed in a white color that blends into his jacket until you look closely.

If we back it up a little bit, after graduation, the now 38-year-old took up work as an events coordinator in Atlanta.
