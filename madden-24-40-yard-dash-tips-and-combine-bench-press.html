So you might want to reduce your player in terms of height, weight, Gut, Chest, Arm size, Arm definition, and other physiques to create the perfect build.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2023 version of Madden allows users to participate in NFL Combine inside Superstar Mode where going through certain mini-games will have a direct impact on your draft stock.</p><p>Your rank in those drills will also determine the types of rewards you will receive to mostly enhance and upgrade your ratings prior to the draft.&nbsp;</p><p>The possibility of the outcome from those mini-games depends highly upon your rating at the start determined by the archetype decided while creating the Avatar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=40-yard-timing-madden-24><span class=ez-toc-section id=madden-24-40-yard-timing></span> Madden 24 40 Yard Timing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Madden 24 40 Yard Time record is 4.07 seconds by Primetime Prince and John Madden. The average timing is 4.25 seconds for 99 Speed rated athletes.</p><p>Ideal timing for the 40-yard dash can be set in the range of 4.6 seconds to 4.9 seconds at the fastest. On average, it can go up from 4.23 to 4.26. Generally, seconds below five are considered good.&nbsp;</p><p>Speed is an important attribute in your player’s overall league performance. For that reason, the dash run is considered an important drill to obscure your speed rating.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you picked a player with a dash run time of 4.24 seconds, it is in the speed range of 97, 98, and 99. This indicates your player will have at least 97 speed which can go up to 98 or 99.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-do-40-yard></span>How To Do 40 Yard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>First, go to the Superstar Mode.</li><li>Then ‘Continue or Start A New Superstar Career’ of your desired position.</li><li>Go to ‘Create Your Profile’.

That is very important to make a good run.</li><li>You need to focus on the controllers. Push down both sticks at the start, let them go at the accurate time, and finally alternate the left and right triggers till you reach the end.</li><li>The most important thing is that you should press the ‘dig deep’ button while still alternating the left and right.</li></ul><h2 id=bench-press-madden-24><span class=ez-toc-section id=madden-24-combine-bench-press></span> Madden 24 Combine Bench Press<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Madden 24 offers you to go through NFL Combine Bench Press drills where you can achieve maximum reps to improve your rating.</p><p>It is an important part of NFL Scouting that will highly determine the player’s strength. The average number varies according to the position.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-do-bench-press></span>How To Do Bench Press?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In Madden 24, once you are inside NFL Combine completing all the previous activities up to determining your avatar’s physique, you will be led to the scouting event. There your first drill will be the bench press. To perform that:</p><ul><li>On the screen, you will see a bar with green and red colors. The upper red indicates your stamina penalty. The lower green is your lift target and the upper green is your release target.</li><li>Push both LS and RS buttons together and release in the target zone.&nbsp;</li><li>When the bar falls, you need to build up your stamina by pressing LB and RB rapidly, often called bumpers.</li><li>You will have to repeat the same steps as long as you can to reach the maximum reps.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The ideal value for a bench press with a 99-strength score is 45.7. This also depends upon the position you have chosen to go with. The CB and LB positions will have different reps averages.</p><p>For example, a player achieves 32 reps at a combine and 35 on the Pro Day. Now, if we look at the chart above, both numbers should fit into one single strength. The 87 and 88 Strength fits the 31-35 reps and 32-36 reps range in them respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>This means the player’s overall strength must be between 87 and 88. In this way, you can determine the strength of your player as well as the bench press score.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=madden-24-interview-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=combine-interview-questions-madden-24></span> Combine Interview Questions Madden 24<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Q.
