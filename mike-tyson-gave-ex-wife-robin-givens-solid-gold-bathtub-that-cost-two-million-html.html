Mostly, they were due to a rape accusation and conviction, his temper, his jealousy over his wives, and his financial woes.</p><p id=par-3_30>The truth is lavish spending was a huge part of Tyson’s life. He came from a background that didn’t allow it and embraced it fully when he had the chance.</p><h2 id=h-the-price-of-luxury-how-much-did-the-high-life-cost-mike-tyson>The price of luxury: how much did the high life cost Mike Tyson?</h2><p id=par-4_48>Though Tyson didn’t come from money, he certainly knew what to do with it when he found it. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post</a>, some estimates are that he spent around “$4.5 million on cars and motorcycles, $3.4 million on clothes and jewelry, and $7.8 million on personal expenses.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_41>For a while, it seems as though no price was too high for Tyson. He spent a fortune on two white <a href=#>Bengal tigers</a> and their trainer. The big cats cost $140,000 and then their trainer was another $125,000 each year.</p><p id=par-6_27>However, this was nothing compared to the bathtub that he purchased for his first wife, <a href=#>Robin Givens</a>, and a birthday party for her that totaled around $410,000.</p><p id=par-7_36>It was a bathtub that he ended up keeping when the two divorced, but eventually, Tyson parted with it.

Although Tyson’s autobiography says that Givens was a good step for him, she filed for a divorce claiming that Tyson was abusive and jealous.</p><p id=par-9_21>Perhaps the jealousy had cause, as Tyson claimed that he walked in on an intimate moment between Givens and Brad Pitt.</p><p id=par-10_23>It has been said that the two had a very rocky relationship from the start. Therefore, the two never had kids together.</p><p id=par-11_37>The kids did not come for Tyson until his second rocky marriage to Monica Turner in 1997. With <a href=#>Turner, two kids</a> were born, but it ultimately ended in divorce after she claimed that Tyson cheated on her.</p><h2 id=h-where-are-givens-and-tyson-today>Where are Givens and Tyson today?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_32>Givens is doing well, but she is staying under the radar, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>. Though there are rumors that she received a $10 million settlement during her divorce, she denies it.</p><p id=par-13_36>Because of this, it is estimated that her net worth is only around $1 to $3 million. However, it may change since the actor released her newest movie Saints & Sinners: Judgment Day in February 2021.</p><p id=par-14_26>After her divorce from Tyson, she remarried in 1997 to <a href=#>Svetozar Marinkovic</a>, but it was also short-lived. The two divorced in 1998. She has two children.</p><p id=par-15_35>Tyson would eventually get his world worked out, and he married his third wife, Lakiha “Kiki” Spicer, in 2009. They have two kids. He recently developed, with her help, a Broadway show, The Undisputed Truth.</p><p id=par-16_43>At one time, it was estimated that Tyson amassed approximately $300 million, but that was before his troubles really began. Today, it is estimated that his net worth is around $3 million, which isn’t bad considering he lost it all at one time.</p><p id=par-17_16><strong>Related: <a href=#>Mike Tyson Owed $60 Million In Debt—Here’s His Secret to How He Turned Things Around</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrfEZquyq5%2Bjeqit1Z5knrBdrLansYyrppuhnmK0qsLEp6pmq5%2BhtqV5xqijnWWSlsGpwNSbZK2gkal6pLvSrWStr59iuqq4y6Kmp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./oakes-wayne-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-310980-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Oakes Wayne Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
