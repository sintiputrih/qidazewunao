Taylor was born on September 9, 1969, in New Jersey, USA, under the zodiac sign Virgo. Because she rose to notoriety as a famous wife, nothing is known about her family history.</p><p>Murphy did, however, spend the majority of her childhood in her hometown of New Jersey. She is no longer alive in the world as of 2022, having died in the year 2009 at the age of 40.</p><p>Murphy also belonged to the African-American ethnicity and was an American by nationality.</p><h2><span id=What_was_Tisha_Taylor_Murphy8217s_occupation>What was Tisha Taylor Murphy’s occupation?</span></h2><p>There is no information about Tisha’s professional life other than her status as comedian Charlie’s wife. She was very discreet about her personal life, so it’s no surprise that she never discussed her profession.</p><p>However, her late husband Charlie was a well-known figure in the American entertainment industry. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he began his career as a small part in various films. He rose to international prominence as a recurrent performer on Chappelle’s Show after working on numerous projects.</p><p>Murphy later worked as a writer and performer in a number of TV shows and films. Charlie was a voice-over artist in addition to being a writer and actor. He voiced Spock in the G4TV Star Trek 2.0 shorts, as well as the dog in his younger brother Eddie Murphy’s film Norbit.</p><h2><span id=Tisha_Taylor_was_married_to_her_husband_Charlie_Murphy_for_12_years>Tisha Taylor was married to her husband Charlie Murphy for 12 years:</span></h2><p>In terms of their wedding, Tisha married her actor spouse Charlie in August 1997. Their marriage was lovely, and according to her husband Charlie, the couple was made for each other. Charlie previously stated about his friendship with Tisha,</p><p>“We fit,” I don’t think you’ll ever meet another individual that fits like that. She wasn’t even a different person. You know what I mean when I say she’s a mirror.</p><p>Unfortunately, the two remained together until Taylor’s death in 2009. For nearly 12 years, they lived as husband and wife. Throughout their marriage, there was no news of a quarrel or a breakup in their married life in the public. Instead, the late couple held firm in each other’s thick and thin.</p><h2><span id=Tisha_and_her_husband_Charlie_met_through_mutual_friends>Tisha and her husband Charlie met through mutual friends.</span></h2><p>Tisha met her future husband Charlie on a boat while out for dinner with friends.</p><p>Murphy’s husband revealed in an exclusive interview with BET that it was love at first sight for him.</p><p>It happened in an instant for me. Tisha and I met for the first time on a boat. She was out to dinner with several buddies. She had no idea who I was, so I invited her to accompany me. Her friends advised her against going. She, on the other hand, did.</p><p>And they fell in love right away. The late comedian revealed in the same interview that the two “drove straight to my brother’s house.” My mum was present. My stepfather was also present. Eddie was present. They were all gathered in the kitchen. “When I walked in, I said, ‘This is my future wife.'”</p><p>The rest, as they say, is history!</p><h2><span id=She_was_a_mother_of_two_children>She was a mother of two children.</span></h2><p>Tisha Taylor Murphy had two children as a result of her marriage to her adored spouse. On June 18, 1999, she gave birth to her first child, Xavier Murphy. Their son will be 23 years old in 2023.</p><p>Similarly, her daughter Eva Murphy was born in 2006. Her precise birth date is uncertain, although she was 11 years old when her father, Charlie Murphy, died in 2017. Tisha’s lone kid will most likely be a high school student in 2022.</p><h2><span id=Tisha_Taylor_Murphy_died_at_the_age_of_40_from_natural_causes>Tisha Taylor Murphy died at the age of 40 from natural causes.</span></h2><p>Tisha Murphy, Charlie Murphy’s wife, died in 2009. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer two years before her death in 2007, which devastated the entire family. Charlie, her husband, revealed in an interview that he was heartbroken when his then-wife told him about her terminal sickness.</p><p>When I got home, she was crying in the kids’ room. That’s when she revealed herself to me. Cancer of the cervix. You don’t fully understand it. You go insane when someone tells you they’re going to die.</p><p>He went on to say,</p><p>The instant you hear those words, you become a different person. A young lady like that — she doesn’t drink, smoke, or use drugs. I know folks in their 90s that do all of that.</p><p>Murphy later battled cervical cancer for two years before succumbing to it on December 14, 2009. She died while sleeping at her New Jersey home.</p><h2><span id=Tisha_Arranged_Her_Own_Funeral_Her_Husband_And_Children_Were_Significantly_Affected_By_Her_Death>Tisha Arranged Her Own Funeral; Her Husband And Children Were Significantly Affected By Her Death</span></h2><p>According to her husband Charlie, Tisha made all of the funeral arrangements before her death. He stated,</p><p>“She’s a well-organized lady.” All of the arrangements had been made when she died. “She made her own plans.”</p><p>Tisha passed away, but her husband and children were destroyed. Regarding this, her husband expressed his sorrow and stated,</p><p>“I’ll always miss my wife, but she said, ‘Go on with your life.'” Look for someone who can make you happy.”</p><p>Despite being in excruciating grief from the loss of his beloved, Charlie did his best to provide for his children, who were 10 and 4 at the time their mother died. He stated,</p><p>“I’m trying to be as present as possible,” she says. “I have a nanny, but the nanny is not mommy.” … Daddy must be present. I make an effort to see my children as much as possible. Every morning and every evening. I’ll prepare their meals myself. I don’t pay someone else to do that for me. I’m very aware that they will grow up and remember all of this.”</p><p>So, even though Tisha’s small children lost their mother when they were young, they always had a responsible and caring father at their side. Tisha’s husband never married again after her death, despite the fact that her dying wish on her death bed was for her cherished life partner to remarry.</p><h2><span id=Tisha8217s_husband_Charlie_Murphy_died_eight_years_after_she_did_What_Disease_Did_Charlie_Murphy_Have>Tisha’s husband, Charlie Murphy, died eight years after she did: What Disease Did Charlie Murphy Have?</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Charlie died on April 12, 2017, eight years after his wife, at the age of 57. He was battling leukemia and receiving Chemotherapy in a New York City hospital. Unfortunately, he did not survive and died in the hospital on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Charlie’s family thought he was doing well with his chemotherapy treatment, but his abrupt death surprised his children and other family members. Charlie Murphy’s three children, brother Eddie Murphy, and half-brother Vernon Lynch survive him.</p><h2><span id=Tisha8217s_Net_Worth>Tisha’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that her job was unknown, numerous media outlets estimated her net worth to be about $1 million.</p><p>Her famous spouse Charlie Murphy, on the other hand, died with a wealth of $2.5 million. His lucrative entertainment profession was his main source of money.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
