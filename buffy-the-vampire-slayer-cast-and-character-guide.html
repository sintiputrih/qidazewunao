It was one of the first supernatural drama series on TV and spawned generations more like it, with the likes of <strong>Charmed</strong> and franchise spinoff <strong>Angel</strong> following shortly after. However, Buffy still reigns. For fans who grew up with the show, it's cathartic in its allegories and provides a sense of solidarity and camaraderie. Long-time viewers feel like they're a part of the Scooby Gang; they learn and grow with Buffy, Willow, and Xander, and discover just how much one person can fight through and still come out in one piece. Buffy is still an inspiration to underdogs everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With so much time having passed since its time on the air, we've seen our favorite demon-fighting actors do quite a lot of great work since Buffy.

No one could carry the fate of the world on their shoulders with that much sass and style and still draw tears from viewers when her own world fell apart. Buffy fought for seven years on the Hellmouth while losing loved ones and growing up faster than any teenager should have. Buffy was the epitome of strength, and many still revere her for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar was also involved with some prime projects, including <strong>Scream 2</strong>, <strong>I Know What You Did Last Summer</strong>, <strong>Cruel Intentions</strong>, and the <a href=#>first <strong>Scooby-Doo</strong> live-action film</a>. After BTVS ended in 2003, Gellar continued showing up on the big screen in the Scooby-Doo sequel <strong>Monsters Unleashed</strong>, as well as in <strong>The Grudge</strong>, the American adaptation of the Japanese horror film, <strong>Ju-On</strong>. Gellar had a couple of TV stints that only lasted one season, including The CW's <strong>Ringer</strong>, about identity theft and the secrets of the wealthy, and CBS's <a href=#><strong>The Crazy Ones</strong></a>, co-starring <strong>Robin Williams</strong> and following an unconventional advertising agency. Sarah Michelle Gellar is also co-founder of Foodstirs, an online shop that sells baking kits, and she has her own cookbook, Stirring Up Fun With Food.</p><p>SMG returned to the small screen earlier this year and for the first time in a long time, she was back in her element in a supernatural role.

Willow is dorky and loyal and goes through a massive character transformation. Her development was the most prominent in the entire show. She goes from sweet, nerdy Willow to a badass witch who almost destroys the world. The exploration of Willow's sexual orientation also gained a lot of respect from fans across the board and invited a new bill of representation into the show. Willow made BTVS magical and was definitely a driving force in the show's popularity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While filming Buffy, Alyson Hannigan also appeared in <a href=#>the <strong>American Pie</strong> movies</a>. Later, Hannigan portrayed the role of Lily Aldrin in the favored sitcom How I Met Your Mother as a series regular from 2005 until the finale in 2014. Actually, a few Buffyverse actors have made appearances on the sitcom, including <strong>Alexis Denisof</strong>, Alyson Hannigan's husband whom she met filming Buffy, with the recurring role of Sandy Rivers. <a href=#><strong>Seth Green</strong></a> and <strong>Amy Acker</strong>, who played Fred in Angel, also appeared on the sitcom. In 2021, Hannigan starred in the superhero comedy-drama <a href=#><strong>Flora & Ulysses</strong></a> as Phyllis Buckman.</p><h2 id=nicholas-brendon-as-xander-harris>Nicholas Brendon as Xander Harris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-nicholas-brendon.jpg><p><strong>Nicholas Brendon</strong> played Alexander Harris, a character either loved or hated by fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Xander was the one among his friends who didn't have supernatural powers or an extensive library of knowledge at the ready, but he relied on his passion and his powers of observation to fight the forces of evil. What made Xander special was that he wasn't special, an underlying theme in the emotional waters of BTVS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Buffy, Brendon landed the role of Kevin Lynch in the <a href=#>crime series <strong>Criminal Minds</strong></a>. He also appeared in the 2013 sci-fi psychological thriller <strong>Coherence</strong>, in which the passing of a comet is tied to a series of strange occurrences involving alternate dimensions and doppelgÃ¤ngers. Brendon is currently a professional visual artist; his latest gallery tour was in 2019 and in 2020 he released a "Fall Art Collection."</p><h2 id=anthony-stewart-head-as-rupert-giles>Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Buffy---Rupert-Giles.jpg><p>Giles, portrayed by <a href=#><strong>Anthony Stewart Head</strong></a>, was everyone's favorite father figure. Although appointed as Buffy's watcher and mentor, he played a fatherly role to everyone in the gang. For most of the show, that gang couldn't get anything done without Giles consulting his books. His dark, demon-raising past gave an edge to his character that invited reverence and made his fighting abilities unquestionable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Buffy, Head gained prominence in the musical theater scene as well as in a number of BBC television series.

He also had an appearance in the film <strong>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</strong> and played the character Chiron in <strong>Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters</strong>. His latest roles include playing Rupert Mannion in the comedy series <a href=#><strong>Ted Lasso</strong></a>, appearing as Lord Sheffield in <strong>Bridgerton</strong>, and Bill in the British sitcom <strong>Motherland</strong>.

He was Buffy's first love, and to a lot of fans, her only true love. They had a volatile relationship and Angel was constantly breaking Buffy's heart, but the love never faded. At the end of Season 3, Angel left Sunnydale (and Buffy) to pursue his own battle with evil and search for the answers pertaining to his resurrection. At the onset of Buffy Season 4, audiences got the debut of the spinoff series, Angel, running for five seasons.</p><p>David Boreanaz had a stint on the big screen in 2001 in the slasher film <strong>Valentine</strong>, but other than that, he is primarily known for his work on the small screen. After Angel, he landed the role of FBI Agent Seeley Booth in the crime series Bones, co-starring alongside <strong>Emily Deschanel</strong>. Bones ran from 2005 to 2017. Following his role as Agent Booth, Boreanaz moved on to play <a href=#>Jason Hayes in the show <strong>SEAL Team</strong></a> until 2022. As of today, he is still involved in the nail polish business his wife, <strong>Jaime Bergman</strong>, started with her friends, called Chrome Girl.

Spike was introduced in Season 2 as Buffy's chaos-inducing nemesis, along with his sire and vampire girlfriend, Drusilla, portrayed by <strong>Juliet Landau</strong>. However, over the seasons, Spike went through a progressive character transformation: from enemy to informant, to ally, to love interest. There's an ongoing heat on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffy-boards</a> between "Bangel" and "Spuffy" fans. Sarah Michelle Gellar herself has stated that she believes Buffy's true love was always Angel, while series creator <strong>Joss Whedon</strong> is pro-Spike. Spike also made a cross-over to Angel, where he remained a central character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Buffy and Angel, Marsters has had a pretty consistent career both on and off-screen. He was in the films <strong>P.S. I Love You</strong> and <strong>Dragon Ball Evolution</strong>. Incidentally, Marsters has worked quite a bit in the Dragon Ball franchise, voicing Zamasu in the English dub of <strong>Dragon Ball Super </strong>and various games. Along with recurring roles in the <strong>Smallville</strong> series and the short-lived <strong>Witches of East End</strong>, he's made appearances in a number of live-action and animated TV shows. Marsters has been a recording and performing musician for many years, as both a solo artist and in the band <strong>Ghost of the Robot</strong>. He has also voiced audiobooks, most notably the Dresden Files, a fantasy-mystery series written by <strong>Jim Butcher</strong>. Marsters most recent work is in the 2023-released puppet horror film <strong>Abruptio</strong>, which also stars <strong>Jordan Peele</strong>, <strong>Robert Englund</strong>, and more in voice roles.

It was on the show Angel, however, that Cordelia really got her shine. Audiences saw a massive character shift and watched Cordelia grow into an amazing woman with nothing but love to give.

He was Willow's high school sweetheart and the lead guitarist for the band Dingoes Ate My Baby. He never really said much, but he had superpowers and a quiet kind of bad-boy vibe.

Audiences everywhere suffered a huge loss when Tara was killed off on the show, but it brought another element to Willow's character development and showed us her dark side. Thus, Tara was more of a catalyst for Willow's story, but her smile, strength, and wit warmed the hearts of Buffy fans.</p><p>Besides acting, Benson is a director and producer, and since leaving Buffy has directed and starred in a number of her own films, including <strong>Chance</strong> (also co-starring James Marsters) and <strong>Lovers, Liars & Lunatics</strong>.

When the Summers sisters lost their mother, Buffy assumed the role of Dawn's parent, which was an uphill battle.

Faith and Buffy fought multiple times from Season 3 and on, a showcase of their volatile relationship. While Buffy tried her hand at making a breakthrough with Faith, it was Angel, in his own show, who showed her the path to redemption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides Buffy, Dushku is probably best known for her roles in the comedy films <strong>Bring it On</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</strong></a>.
