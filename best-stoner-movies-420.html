In fact, some have been elevated too high art and have Rotten Tomatoes ratings that outpace work by actors and directors who have Academy Award statuettes on their mantles.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">But what makes a good stoner flick? In this writer's humble opinion, it actually has to include smoking - eliminating a classic duo like Bill and Ted where their "hobby" is merely suggested, and plots that would make someone high bust a gut, or question their own existences like The Truman Show, but does't actually speak to the counterculture.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Even certifiable "classics" which have gained cult status in the genre - like Half Baked and Up in Smoke - have dreadful reviews (sitting at 29 percent and 41 percent) which suggests it's hard to make weed the backbone of a plot.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Thus, the sweet spot seems to be a stoner movie where characters exist as real and eccentric entities, rather than stereotypes, where the usage of marijuana is a regular part of those character's worlds.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">In honor of 4/20, here are the best reviewed stoner movies you can watch right now...after you order a pizza...and struggle to remember your parents' Netflix code.</p><h3 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading20___ZBJHd contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Scroll down to check out the best stoner movies and the best films for 4/20</h3><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Dazed and Confused</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong> 93 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There are very few 4/20 films which capture the coming of age qualities that Richard Linklater was able to accomplish with&nbsp;Dazed and Confused. In addition to spot on casting which included jocks, nerds, burn outs and kids experiencing high-school for the first time, Linklater also devoted 1/6 of the entire film's budget to the music department to secure rights to songs like Bob Dylan’s “Hurricane,” Aerosmith’s “Sweet Emotion,” and Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out" which added to the overall vibe he wanted.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Marijuana is present in the very first shot of the film. Slater also had a very interesting theory that George Washington grew weed. Adding to the overall marijuana aesthetic, Linklater has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a> that he attempted to present a very professional set where the usage of alcohol and drugs were prohibited, but he would later learn that many of the cast were often stoned during actual filming.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">True Romance</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong> 92 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">As his follow up to Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino penned the Bonnie and Clyde-esque story of of Clarence and Alabama which on-paper seems much more like a hard-boiled crime drama - with classic Tarantino forays in the dialogue and bloodshed department - than a movie rooted in marijuana culture.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">However, thanks to <a href=#>Brad Pitt's</a> portrayal of Floyd, it will always have a special place in the heart for people who all have had a stoner friend just like him who could never see the serious side of any situation.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Easy Rider</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong> 89 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">You know a film had an impact on marijuana culture when the title becomes the name of a strain.

In the case of The Big Lebowski, Jeff Bridge's character is a free spirit who can' be bothered by the expectations bestowed upon an adult like rent, responsible car ownership, or maintaining a small reserve of cash for instances like buying a carton of milk.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">This Is the End</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong> 82 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">In recent years, comedies have utilized actors playing elevated versions of themselves to blur the lines between the cinematic universe and real life. In turn, people like Neil Patrick Harris, Larry David, John Malkovich, and Bill Murray have furthered their cases as cult icons.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">This Is the End doubles down on the idea to great stoner effect because stars Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson are all good friends in real life. And since we as the audience know them to be huge stars in Hollywood, watching them freak out and turn against one another is that much more satisfying.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong> 78 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There are very few characters in the history of cinema whose surname alone has come to represent the burn-out stereotype.

But as we're all well aware, Harold Ramis decided to turn the conventional elitist stereotype on its head by spotlighting the "regular" people who keep the operation afloat.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">As far as plots go, the most striking aspect of Caddyshack involves a tortured groundskeeper waging war on a a gopher. But along the way, Bill Murray reveals himself to be someone who also considers enlightenment and the Dali Lama, and has concocted his own strain of weed. In Carl Spackler, it's as if one of the Three Stooges took up Buddhism.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Friday</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:</strong>74 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Friday is the rare film where using weed to initiate the hero's journey actually works. In this case, when Craig and Smokey indulge on what would be any other final day of the work week, things go absolutely haywire.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">But hidden amongst the endless laughs is a conclusion that is surprisingly poignant and effective. Craig's father, Mr. Jones, urges his son to take on the behemoth that is Deebo with only his fists. It may not have been going for an anti-violence message completely, but there's something to take away from the idea, "you win some, you lose some, but you live to fight another day."</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh"><strong>Rottent Tomatoes Rating:&nbsp;</strong>74 percent</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The munchies have caused people to do all sorts of weird things.
