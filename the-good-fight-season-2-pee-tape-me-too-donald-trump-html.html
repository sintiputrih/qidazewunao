than any other TV show this season, The Good Fight knows how to spin real-life news into ripped-from-the-headlines drama. Much as they did in The Good Wife, the show’s creators, Robert and Michelle King, tend to avoid giving lectures, and instead situate their characters in the middle of major news stories, then figure out how to make them scheme their way through it all.&nbsp;In the Trump era, that approach has gotten more potent than ever. “We make sure to satirize both sides, but things have tipped to such a degree that it would be false to suggest that there’s parity there,” Robert King told Vulture.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceqt002a3b60gjji1ajq@published data-word-count=100>That idea drives <a href=#>The Good Fight’s second season</a>, which depicts a world where the news has gotten so bizarre, the only solution is to get bizarre yourself. Diane Lockhart, the typically buttoned-up lawyer played by Christine Baranski, starts <a href=#>microdosing psilocybin</a>, watches too much cable TV, and gets into the Korean martial art hapkido. Where she once loved the law, she now embraces opportunity. “Do the laws hold, and if they don’t hold, what do you do?” Robert King said of Diane’s mind-set. “I don’t think we approve of that. There’s an element of tragedy buried under a lot of comedy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3celn001r3b60wcnca9rx@published data-word-count=77>Along that tragic arc, the Kings wove salacious news stories from the past year into their own, off-kilter universe. The lawyers at the heart of the CBS All Access series debate everything from a version of the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise scandal</a> to the existence of <a href=#>the mythical “pee tape.”</a> Vulture talked with the Kings about nine of the biggest headlines that got the Good Fight treatment, and the one they just couldn’t figure out how to crack.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig3d022001b3i61c9g63z6t@published>The pee tape</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3celf001q3b60fnqgcfna@published data-word-count=67><strong>The premise: </strong>The Reddick-Boseman firm works with Russian models who claim to have been involved in the infamous and alleged “golden showers” tape with Donald Trump. At first, the firm tries to verify if the tape is real, until Democratic operative Ruth Eastman (Margo Martindale) tells them it’s fake. Later, we learn it might just be real, and see Ruth shelving the tape for the 2020 race.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig3dbsx001r3i613xj7p3tz@published data-word-count=149><strong>How it got on the show: </strong>“I can’t imagine why any show wouldn’t want to tackle that,” Michelle King said of the infamous story included in a dossier by British agent Christopher Steele claiming that, in 2013, <a href=#>Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a Moscow hotel bed where President Obama had previously slept</a>. The story has everything: It’s salacious, it’s surreal, it’s got a heck of a MacGuffin. It’s also hard to depict without getting in trouble for claiming that the pee tape really is real. “The writers room was wanting to pursue it, but what we always needed was a way in that is legal and is more about our show,” Robert King said. To that end, The Good Fight never reveals the purported tape, but instead lets us watch the characters watch it, as a yellow glow emanates from their laptops, in a nod to Pulp Fiction.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3cen5001u3b600rnwuqvc@published data-word-count=43>“Part of it is satirizing, what do you do when you have a presidency that is all about porn stars and golden showers?” Robert said. “Then, also, what can you say about an opposition that is turned on by finding that disgusting thing?”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig3hwpo001x3i614vw01qa2@published>The Bachelor in Paradise scandal</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3cen7001v3b60mdhrvmdm@published data-word-count=91><strong>The premise: </strong>The firm investigates a scandal on the set of a reality show called Chicago Penthouse, after a producer shuts down filming amid concerns that one contestant, Melanie (Isabella Farrell), was too drunk to consent to sex with another drunk contestant. Melanie sues the network for disregarding her safety, but the network claims it isn’t responsible for her assault. However, Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele) eventually finds footage from a third spy camera, revealing that a producer pulled Melanie’s unconscious body back to the hot tub where the assault took place.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig3i20m00223i61c3jdw5t9@published data-word-count=128><strong>How it got on the show: </strong>The Kings were fascinated by<a href=#> the Bachelor in Paradise story</a>, and specifically how the issue of consent might play out within the unreality of reality TV. Joey Heartstone, one of the show’s writers, had gotten his start on Project Runway and helped them add a “layer of reality” to the episode. They also wanted to critique how those sorts of shows trick viewers into buying the fictions they create.<strong> </strong>“It’s this sense of reality TV and how it’s manufactured reality,” Robert said, “Which also you see how it’s played into the sense of our president being this great businessman. I still think the serious press still treats him as someone who created that show, when in fact he was cast in that.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig3qjex002b3i61o2i717kq@published>#MeToo</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3cen4001t3b60pngrng8g@published data-word-count=67><strong>The premise: </strong>While the firm works for a broadcast network planning to air an exposé accusing a male movie star of sexual assault, Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo) wonders if he gave preferential treatment to his ex-wife, Liz (Audra McDonald), when he was a guest lecturer at her law school — but only after Naomi Nivola (Keesha Sharp), the journalist behind the exposé, <a href=#>subtly calls out his behavior</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig3rjso002h3i617116fmy9@published data-word-count=42><strong>How it got on the show: </strong>“We wanted it to be nuanced,” Michelle said. “The best way to do that is to show that a character that we certainly love and admire also has something in his past he needs to reconsider.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceod001x3b60cz989rns@published data-word-count=66>“We live in a world where we are dealing with female and male writers so closely in the writers room,” Robert King said. “You always go through, Did you shut somebody down too quickly?

Both parties agree on what happened during the date — he performed oral sex on her — but disagree on their interpretations. She claims he pressured her into sex; he believes it was mutual. As the firm investigates the case, the office argues about it, with many of the younger employees taking the woman’s side. Later in the episode, Diane confronts the woman behind the Assholes to Avoid list, who accuses her of being a bad feminist and betraying the cause.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig40b5y002y3i61gxg1z0t8@published data-word-count=92><strong>How it got on the show: </strong>“Whenever there are arguments in the writers room, that’s when you know a topic is fertile,” Michelle King said, adding that the arguments in the Reddick-Boseman offices mirrored the ones happening among the show’s writers. “One can certainly do episodes of television about someone that breaks into a home and rapes a woman, but I don’t think there is any question about knowing that’s wrong,” Michelle said. “To be in areas where folks aren’t recognizing that their behavior is wrong is far more interesting to us.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceoc001w3b607z68srsk@published data-word-count=77>The Kings added that Diane’s confrontation with the woman behind the list was inspired by the fight between <a href=#>MSNBC host Ashleigh Banfield and Babe.net’s Katie Way</a>, who wrote <a href=#>the Ansari story</a>. “I remember there were some nasty lines in the letter [from Way to Banfield] about second-wave feminism,” Robert said. “It got into hairstyles,” Michelle added. “That argument was really potent in the room, there was a generational aspect and attitude toward who was right,” Robert said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceof001z3b60ac7akivt@published data-word-count=73>In the episode, Diane ultimately convinces the woman to take “Assholes to Avoid” down, but her position is mostly a practical one: She tells her to just hire a lawyer next time. “What’s fun, too, is when she recognizes that there’s a chance she was played,” Robert said, in reference to how the firm’s backers planed to bleed the site to death by suing them, a reference to <a href=#>Peter Thiel’s attacks on Gawker</a>.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig48ewb00353i61sg6qqy0n@published>Impeaching Trump</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceot00203b60vlb7r9kb@published data-word-count=67><strong>The premise: </strong>The DNC hires the firm to find the best strategy for impeaching Trump. Adrian wants to use the emoluments clause; Diane suggests obstruction of justice; Julius (Michael Boatman), a Republican, says they should wait to vote him out.

In turn, she watches a series of cable news stories that teeter between reality and hallucination. For instance: that Trump is keeping a pig in the White House map room, that he might bring goats to a European summit, and that he has signed an order allowed “the planting of firecrackers in the rectums of grizzly bears.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig4lj8000403i61gdcjgxxz@published data-word-count=96><strong>How it got on the show: </strong>Diane’s exhaustion mirrors the Kings’ own frustrations with the news. Robert remember their daughter telling them, last year, that “the White House press secretary just said that Steve Bannon can suck his own cock.” “First of all, that’s not terribly witty and your sense of humor is better than that, and second of all, that’s vulgar,” Michelle remembered responding, until their daughter explained she was <a href=#>directly quoting Anthony Scaramucci</a>. “Of course, we had to go back and apologize to her when we realized she was simply telling us the truth.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceqi00233b60stblwapx@published data-word-count=64>“Based on that,” Robert said, “we wanted these head-turning news stories that just had enough of a ring of truth that you go, ‘Oh wait, was that yesterday’s news?’” Occasionally, The Good Fight’s stories seemed <a href=#>prescient</a>, though most veered into the extreme. “We have Donald Trump talking to mermaids, so I wasn’t overly worried that it was going to sound too real,” Michelle said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceqi00223b60cdmte6tx@published data-word-count=88>What mattered to the Kings was making sure they also satirized how the Democrat response to Trumpian news plays into its absurdity. “When there’s a typo, for example, everybody reacts to it,” Robert said. In one episode, Trump says he’ll take “5 goats” (instead of “goals”) to a European summit, and Democrats call it out, so Paul Ryan says he can take goats to the summit if he wants. Everyone resorts to knee-jerk reactions and the situation spirals out of control. “That, I could see happening,” Robert said.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig4spsu004g3i61xhss8z8r@published>ICE and immigration</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceqj00253b60lvb0kjqm@published data-word-count=61><strong>The premise: </strong>Immigration authorities go after Jay Dipersia (Nyambi Nyambi), the firm’s investigator, after he’s arrested on a minor charge.

It’s a real worry about this downward spiral of partisanship, that people live in their bubbles,” Robert said. “One way to attack it — where you’re not preaching something everybody knows — is to see how micro-targeting could work on a jury.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjig5ud0e006h3i61ifcjkjf8@published data-word-count=33>“It’s fun for us also because you get to see an actor in his ’80s be the person that’s using tech in a wily way,” Michelle added. “That hopefully subverts expectations as well.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjig5v58q007d3i61f7wo5wxa@published>The one story that didn’t make it</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjif3ceqt00293b60swi1us5q@published data-word-count=72><strong>“</strong>One we wanted to pursue this year is <a href=#>Kevin Williamson being fired from The Atlantic</a>,” Robert said. “Just the tendency for people to dig up the worst things about each other to undercut careers and to purify the echo chamber of the right and the left.

The Good Fight’s season-two finale ends, after all, with a copycat murder of the type that plagued the show’s lawyers, this time targeting a reporter.<strong> </strong>“Journalism is the thing that should be least attacked these days,” Robert said, adding, “There is a tendency on editorial pages to only deliver what the New York Times audience or the Washington Post audience already wants. And that interests us. We can’t find a way to get it to work, but it interests us.”</p><h2 class=single-related-story-label>Related</h2><a class=single-related-story-link href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=single-related-story data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cje91oham0094zayeqswcrcpd@published data-track-headline="Christine Baranski on Micro-dosing, The Good Fight, and Mamma Mia! 2" data-track-component-title=related>Christine Baranski on Micro-dosing, The Good Fight, and Mamma Mia! 2</a> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>How The Good Fight Tackled the Pee Tape, #MeToo, and Trump</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdga3y1tMRmnqinlGKzqrPHrWSsnZGovK95kWannp1dqa6xsYymnGasn6R6pbvNmqOdZaSnwq68jaGrpqQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mcu-enemy-francis-ford-coppolas-inability-to-pull-off-a-marvel-level-movie-incites-an-online-riot.html>&#171;&nbsp;MCU enemy Francis Ford Coppolas inability to pull off a Marvel-level movie incites an onlin</a>
