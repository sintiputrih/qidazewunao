Those dancers had initially been booked onto Taylor's tour, however, after being asked to join Katy's tour instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not doing much dancing with Taylor, they decided to jump ship, and this was just the beginning of the issues between the pair.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Katy Perry's Career Declined After Her Infamous Feud With Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>They have also allegedly both released songs about each other. Taylor was the first one as her song 'Bad Blood' is supposed to be about her feud with Katy, with Katy following suit a few years later with the release of her song 'Swish Swish', which is allegedly about Taylor.</p><p>Neither star has specifically stated their songs were about one another, but fan speculation helped the theory take off. To date, it's generally assumed the theory is correct.</p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-respond-to-the-feud-with-katy-perry>Did Taylor Swift Respond To The Feud With Katy Perry?</h2><p>During the feud, the two were always seen trying to 'one-up' each other, with <a href=#>Katy even being accused in the past of trying to reignite the feud</a> by constantly bringing Taylor's name up whenever she could as a way of drumming up a bit of attention (which also helped if she happened to have an album or single coming out at the same time).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Katy Perry Throws Subtle Shade At Taylor Swift During Idol Audition</a></span></p><p>However, Taylor is no angel in this situation either as she too has been accused of making the feud go further than it needed to go as a way of getting her music higher in the charts than Katy's. The whole thing was all down to Spotify.</p><p>Fans may or may not remember that there was a time when Taylor refused to have her music available on Spotify or any other music streaming platform other than Apple Music because she didn't like that the number of "paid album sales had fallen drastically" and she didn't agree with the idea of music being free.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52757069-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this all appeared to change three years later in 2017 as in a shock move, Taylor decided to return to Spotify and all other streaming platforms. The decision was supposedly made to thank fans for getting her album '1989' to sell 10 million copies worldwide, however, many seemed to think there was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deeper reason behind this decision</a>.</p><p>What many realized was that on the same day that Taylor was releasing her music back onto steaming services, Katy was releasing her album 'Witness.' It's not known if Taylor was in talks with the streaming services prior to this date or how long talks were going on to allow the music to be released on each platform at the same time.</p><p>However, there's absolutely no way Taylor didn't know Katy was releasing her album on that date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Katy Perry, Taylor Swift & 9 Other Celeb Duos Who Have Bad Blood Between Them</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This all came about at a time when the pair were in the midst of their feud and despite them having since made up, this incident isn't likely to have helped matters.
