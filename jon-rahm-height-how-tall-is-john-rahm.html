style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Jon Rahm height-Spanish professional golfer,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jon Rahm Rodriguez</a>&nbsp;was born on November 10th, 1994 in Barrika, Basque Country, Spain.</strong></p><p>He competed for Spain as an amateur on various levels and was a member of the Spanish teams that won the 2011 and 2014 European Amateur Team Championships. He was the individual leader at the 2014 Eisenhower Trophy.</p><p>He received a golf scholarship to attend Arizona State University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. There, he was second in school history with 11 victories in college golf competitions, only behind Phil Mickelson’s 16 victories.</p><p>Rahm became the first golfer to receive the Ben Hogan Award twice when he won it in 2015 and 2016. At the 2014 Eisenhower Trophy, he was likewise the most prominent participant. During his junior year, he participated in the 2015 Phoenix Open as an amateur and tied for fifth place, three strokes behind the champion.</p><p>Rahm rose to the top spot in the World Amateur Golf Ranking on April 1, 2015, becoming the 28th player to hold that position. After holding it for 25 straight weeks, he gave it up, got it back, and held onto it for an additional 35 weeks.</p><p>His total of 60 weeks at the top of the list is a record. He reached the 2015 U.S. Open quarterfinals while holding the No. 1 ranking in the entire globe.</p><p>As the top amateur golfer in 2015, he received the Mark H. McCormack Medal, which entitles him to the U.S. Open and Open Championship the following year.</p><p>Before finishing tied for third in the national final, he finished his collegiate career by capturing the Pac-12 Conference title and an NCAA regional title.</p><p>He finished his final tournament as an amateur in a tie for 23rd place at 7-over-par, making him the low amateur in the 2016 U.S. Open.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jon Rahm career</h2><p>Rahm’s exemption to the 2016 Open Championship was lost when he turned professional following the U.S. Open. Rahm took part in his first professional competition the following week at the Quicken Loans National.</p><p>He finished tied for third place, four strokes behind the winner, Billy Hurley III, after holding or sharing the lead for the first two rounds. Rahm’s performance was sufficient to re-enter The Open because the Quicken Loans National was a part of the Open Qualification Series.</p><p>Rahm scored his first PGA Tour victory at the Farmers Insurance Open in late January 2017 with a 60-foot eagle putt on the last hole. With the victory, he improved his position in the Official World Golf Ranking from 137 to 46 and qualified for the Masters Tournament, The Players’ Championship, PGA Championship, and World Golf Championships.</p><p>Rahm finished second to Dustin Johnson in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, his second WGC event.</p><p>Rahm placed joint-27th in his first Masters tournament. He subsequently finished fourth in the Wells Fargo Tournament and joint-runner-up in the Dean & DeLuca Invitational, accomplishments that propelled him into the top 10 of the world rankings.</p><p>Rahm won the 2017 European Tour season’s last competition, the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. Because he was first among rookies in the Race to Dubai, he was named the European Tour Rookie of the Year.</p><p>Rahm began the year with placing second at the Sentry Tournament of Champions in Kapalua, Hawaii, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson.</p><p>Rahm has developed a reputation for having a fierce on-course temper in his brief professional career. This was evident during the final round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open when he smacked his club into the ground.</p><p>Rahm won the Open de Espaa on the European Tour in April 2018. Rahm met the requirements to join the European Ryder Cup team in September 2018.</p><p>Rahm and partner Ryan Palmer took home the PGA Tour’s Zurich Classic of New Orleans championship on April 28. Rahm tied for third place on June 16, 2019, at the U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach Golf Course in Pebble Beach, California.</p><p>Rahm triumphed at the Lahinch Golf Club’s Dubai Duty-Free Irish Open on July 7, 2019. Before to the final 18 holes of the competition, Rahm was five strokes behind 54-hole leader Robert Rock.</p><p>Rahm took the top spot in the Official World Golf Ranking on July 19, 2020, after winning the Memorial Tournament. After Seve Ballesteros, he was the second Spaniard in history to hold the top spot.</p><p>Rahm began 2022 at the Hawaii’s Kapalua Resort’s Sentry Tournament of Champions. He played four rounds at 33 under par, including a 61 in the third.</p><p>Rahm won the Mexico Open on May 1 to record his sixth PGA Tour triumph. He finished tied for second at the BMW PGA Championship in September after shooting a final-round 62, one stroke behind Shane Lowry.</p><p>Rahm won the Sentry Tournament of Champions by two strokes over Collin Morikawa after shooting a final-round 63 there to start the year 2023. A six-shot deficit into the final round was overcome by him.</p><p>Rahm regained the world number one ranking by winning the Genesis Invitational in February. Rahm had won five races in nine starts across the globe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How tall is Jon Rahm?</h2><p>Rahm stands at a height of 1.88m tall and weighs 100kg.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOmp2WilrWueceeoKCgpGK1sMOMrZilpF2ewG62zqGlZqqRnbpw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./834013-wwe-payback-results-bayley-vs-alexa-bliss-for-the-wwe-raw-womens-championship.html>&#171;&nbsp;WWE Payback Results: Bayley vs Alexa Bliss for the WWE Raw Womens Championship</a>
