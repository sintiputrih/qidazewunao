Wiki</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Cedric Yarbrough is an American Comedian, Voice Artist, Actor, and Singer who starred on the Comedy Central television series Reno 911! as Deputy S. Jones and on the ABC sitcom Speechless, and also voicing Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface on the Netflix comedy-drama BoJack Horseman.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-boondocks></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Boondocks</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Boondocks, he portrayed a character of&nbsp; Thomas Lancaster DuBois, a wealthy and mild-mannered black man, is an assistant district attorney and close friend of&nbsp;Robert Freeman. Tom, being non-confrontational and skittish by nature, adheres strictly to the law, particularly due to his irrational fear of&nbsp;being sent to prison and anally raped.</p><p>This fear originated when Tom was exposed at a very young age to a television series that depicted a violent prison rape. The fear developed to such a degree that Tom refused to participate in even the slightest of legal infractions (even those that are&nbsp;not&nbsp;punishable by a prison sentence) as a youth and throughout adulthood.</p><p>His job as a prosecuting attorney is ironic: He essentially sends other people (mostly&nbsp;black men) to the fate he himself most fears, and he seems to feel guilty about it. Tom is ultimately forced to confront his phobia in the third-season episode&nbsp;A Date With the Booty Warrior, where he comes face to face with a rapist dubbed “Booty Warrior” after being trapped in a prison washroom during a riot. Tom seemingly conquers his fear after beating the would-be rapist unconscious with a bar of soap (after he slipped and fell on his back), and also mentions to Sarah that he plans on becoming a&nbsp;public defender&nbsp;in order to save young men from being violated in prison.</p><p>Tom’s political ideologies are more towards&nbsp;American liberalism and as a result, he is a&nbsp;Democrat. Tom’s passion for his political ideologies are marked by an incident where he kidnaps&nbsp;Ralph Nader&nbsp;during the&nbsp;2004 United States Presidential election, who he believes is a threat that could stunt the Democratic vote.</p><p>He and his wife are active members of the&nbsp;NAACP&nbsp;and demonstrate a strong understanding of the struggles of African Americans, much as&nbsp;Huey does. Huey is more proactive and confrontational in his approach and general questions to what degree the NAACP helps African Americans. Furthermore, Huey views Tom as part of the white power structure that he detests (i.e., part of the “system”), however, he does show Tom respect as an elder.&nbsp;Riley’s&nbsp;interactions with Tom are few and far between, and (like most adults Riley encounters) he doesn’t respect him. This leaves him prone to clash with Tom in many of the same ways he clashes with his own grandfather.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-age></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yarbrough is 45 years old as of 2019, he was born 20 March 1973, Burnsville, Minnesota, <strong>United States.</strong> He celebrates his birthday on 20 March every year.&nbsp; He will be 46 years old on March 20, 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-height></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span class=w8qArf>&nbsp;He stands at a height of around 6′ 2″.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-education></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He attended&nbsp;Burnsville Senior High School&nbsp;and later&nbsp;Minnesota State University, Mankato.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-parents></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Parents</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After doing our research, details about his parents are not available and it is also not known if he has any siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-gay></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Gay</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is not married neither does he have a wife.

Through proceeds from his work as an actor and comedian, he has been able to accumulate a huge fortune. Cedric is estimated to have a net worth of about $1 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-and-mariah-carey></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough And Mariah Carey</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cedric Yarbrough is letting the world know that he isn’t a fan of Mariah Carey after witnessing her diva behavior firsthand. The singer was set to make a cameo in Will Ferrell’s new film The House, and after the actor talked about the “Obsessed” singer’s behavior on set during an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers, Yarbrough took to Facebook to explain how she “ruined” the cameo, which has since been axed from the movie.</p><p>“Okay since Will Ferrell is talking, I’m talking,” he wrote. “Yeah, a real funny cameo was SUPPOSED to happen in the new film #TheHouse with the superstar Mariah Carey. But it was ruined by superstar Mariah Carey. The film takes place in a suburban home but is made into a ‘Casino.’ Why not have Mariah be an act in the casino? Funny idea. It’s rumored that she eventually showed up to set. This is true. But after waiting for her for 3-4 hours!” The comic went on to add that the music icon even allegedly told the cast and crew how she wanted things done.</p><p>“While we waited the director & team had the idea of doing a stunt that Mariah’s body double would do now & bring in Mariah to match it,” he explained. “They do the stunt. All goes well. When Mariah finally showed up she refused to match the stunt. ‘Darling, I would never do it that way…’. I heard her say those exact words. She then requested a large fan for her hair to be blown around and a camera that would be above her, basically a crane shot.”</p><p>He then firmly added that Mimi “was unprofessional & borderline abusive to our director, who tried his best to appease her every wish.” Yarbrough said he hopes his words teach Carey and aspiring actors a lesson in being professional while in unfamiliar settings and hopes the singer takes his words to heart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-shows></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Shows</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Speechless (TV series) 2016 – 19</li><li>Black Dynamite (TV series) 2011 – 15</li><li>Carol’s Second Act – 2019</li><li>Paradise PD – 2018</li><li>Rake (American TV series) – 2014</li><li>The Boondocks – 2005 -14</li><li>Reno 911 – 2003 – 09</li><li>After Dark With Julian Clark</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cedric-yarbrough-career></span><span>Cedric Yarbrough Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yarbrough starred on the Comedy Central television series Reno 911! as Deputy S.
