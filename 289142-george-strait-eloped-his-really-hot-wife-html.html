He is considered one of the most popular and influential recording artists of all time, with hit singles such as "She Let Herself Go," "Give It Away," and "You'll Be There."</p><p class=fh>But away from being a world-renowned country singer, Strait has also had immense success in his personal life. He and his wife Norma got married five decades ago and have faced life together since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/57f8c500971b51febf818b91f09feac5.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Country singer George Strait and his wife Norma on October 22, 2017 in Nashville, Tennessee. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>Strait also takes pride in being a dad.

Unfortunately, the duo did not meet again for a long while until the singer thought something was "missing" from his life.</p><p class=fh>Fortunately, Norma had not written Strait off after their hiatus, and soon after, they got back together. As the couple celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2021 in Las Vegas, Strait mesmerized the crowd with the cute story of how he first met his wife half a century back. He <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.cmt.com/news/1839847/watch-george-strait-serenades-wife-norma/>shared</a> as his wife smiled at the memories:</p><p class=fh>"So I was 19 years old, and I knew this girl, Norma.

However, all that was shattered by a tragedy that left the family distraught and threatened to turn the "Carrying Your Love With Me" singer's life upside down.</p><p class=fh>Jenifer, then 13, was in a car with her friends when the driver, then 18-year-old Gregory Allen, tried turning, lost control of the Ford Mustang, and rolled over. The window on Jenifer's side was open, and without her safety belt on, she became the only fatality in the June 25, 1986 accident in San Marcos, Texas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e3edf9f4aabe01e9abb78bcb28a9a75e.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Country singer George Strait performs at The Frank Erwin Center on June 3 2018 in Austin Texas | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>A year later, prosecutors <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://apnews.com/article/a183c2b357eb4071822168a43b94ca5f>dropped the charge</a> of criminally negligent homicide against Allen. And while he went free, Jenifer's family still mourned the loss of their little girl. Strait <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-george-strait/>told</a> People:</p><p class=fh>"We were blessed to have been able to spend 13 years with our beautiful daughter Jenifer."</p><p class=fh>"We will all miss Jenifer very much, and we will never forget her, her smile and laugh. She meant the world to us, and we'll miss her dearly." Strait <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/george-straits-kids-meet-children-with-wife-norma-strait/>wrote</a> of his daughter, as Closer Weekly reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3a2f3302a769ae3f4c99715f858c7b4a.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Country singer George Strait and his wife Norma at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 18 2008in Las Vegas Nevada | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>Strait used his music to grieve his beloved daughter, and soon after her demise, he released the song "You'll Be There" to commemorate Jenifer's memories. The singer did not speak much about his loss and grief but had this to <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://abutterflysjourney.org/project/song-youll-be-there/>say</a>: "Obviously, it's a special song for me," <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://abutterflysjourney.org/project/song-youll-be-there/>adding</a>:</p><p class=fh>"You know, the things that have happened in my life and losing my daughter. I believe that someday we will be together again. I think that's what we all strive for; to get to heaven someday."</p><p class=fh>The grief, however, took a toll on him, and he quit the limelight altogether.

He loved her back in the same way and always will, just as we always will."</p><p class=fh>"Because of their nine-year age difference, Jenifer was like a second mother to Bubba in a way," Strait <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/george-straits-kids-meet-children-with-wife-norma-strait/>added</a>.
