However, she’s also become a well-known diva. The singer and actress has been involved in her fair share of controversies over the years. In fact, not many people who have worked with J-Lo have nice things to say about the pop star. Most recently, Colombian singer Maluma revealed what it was like to work with Jennifer Lopez in the movie Marry Me.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jennifer Lopez's Assistant Quit And Worked For Mariah Carey Instead, Because Of Her Hatred Towards J-Lo's Ex-Casper Smart</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-has-been-involved-in-many-controversies-throughout-her-career>Jennifer Lopez Has Been Involved in Many Controversies Throughout Her Career</h2><p>Like many other successful singers and actors, J.Lo has been involved in numerous controversies over the years. On more than one occasion, the pop icon has feuded with celebrities such as Mariah Carey and Brandy, and it’s even rumored that she fought with Cameron Diaz when they worked together in the movie What to Expect When You're Expecting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar51673520.jpg><p>Plus, plenty of people who have worked with J-Lo have revealed that working with the singer is a total nightmare. For example, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rosie Perez revealed that J-Lo manipulated their wardrobe and makeup</a> to her advantage when they worked together in InLiving Color. Perez has also admitted that she and the rest of the dancers of the show considered J.Lo a diva for how rude she was to them backstage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>People That Met Jennifer Lopez Seem To Believe She Has A No Eye Contact Rule</a></span></p><p>Most recently, the On the Floor singer received a lot of backlash after making some rather mean comments about having to perform alongside Shakira in the Super Bowl halftime show.

She once <a href=# rel=nofollow>avoided speaking directly to a flight attendant</a> during a whole trip.

And then I started singing and I forgot the lyrics. And I saw the teleprompter, and the teleprompter went off.” Then he explained how J-Lo was there to support him, “She held me, man.
