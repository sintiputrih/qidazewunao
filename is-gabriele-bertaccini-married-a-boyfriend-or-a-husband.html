Obviously, fans then started asking questions about his love life — if he’s married? Or does he have a boyfriend?</span></p><p><span>Thus, here we are with answers to all these queries relating to Gabriele’s love life.</span></p><h3><b>Is Gabriele Bertaccini Married? Is He With A Boyfriend Or A Husband?</b></h3><p><span>No, Gabriele Bertaccini didn’t seem to be married. However, he was enjoying the dating game, and many believed Reece Carter could be his boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>Gabriele and Reece were indeed close in 2017. The two were often spotted out vacationing and Gabriele often shared their lovely pics on IG. Over one of the posts, he hinted, “Forty-five minutes late and he still manages to smile. I must be THAT charming!”</span></p><p><span>His alleged boyfriend, Reece Carter is a model, an online sensation, and a nutritionist. He first came to the limelight in Jan 2012 as one of the first people to start posting content on Instagram related to fitness and modeling. Later, he gained more traction after writing the book </span><i><span>The Lifestyle Suite</span></i><span>, which discusses various eating habits and diets.</span></p><p><span>In September 2022, he also released another book called </span><i><span>The Girl, the Ghost, and the Lost Name</span></i><span> — a spooky, funny, magical, and atmospheric adventure with a compelling hero.</span></p><p><span>Find Reece on IG @</span><a href=#><span>herbnerdreece</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming back to Gabriele, though he might be enjoying the dating game, he has to be careful with his partners because he’s HIV-positive! Yes, unlike many, Gabriele’s vocal about his disease in hopes that he could inspire others who may be dealing with HIV to be open and honest.</span></p><p><span>The chef first opened up to the world he tested HIV-positive in an episode of </span><i><span>Say I Do back</span></i><span> in 2020. “When you surround yourself with people who are vulnerable — and they are not afraid of sharing their story — the best thing you can do is really show them vulnerability back. And that’s kind of what happened that day when we were filming,” he said.</span></p><p><span>“I’m so thankful that the support I had was one that allowed me to move forward in a healthy way that made me understand this wasn’t something that marked me and made me less than what I was before,” he added. “We have to make sure this support…is available for everyone who goes through that.”</span></p><p><span>Well, his courage indeed paid off as the many dared to come out to their close ones after Gabriele’s emotional reveal. A letter he received from a fan read, “I tested positive for HIV two weeks ago. I am sitting here with my mom, and I started crying because I don’t have the courage to tell her. I hope one day I will.”</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Gabriele Bertaccini Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Gabriele Bertaccini flaunted a net worth of above $2 million in 2023.

My mum, like many other Italian mums, cooked a lot! I used to join her in the kitchen all the time, although I had a much more clinical approach to cooking. The cooking my mum used to do is stamped in my head and I can’t replicate it.
