I felt like things were really heavily reliant upon me, and I was getting no time to do any of the other offers that were out there.”</p><p>Barton also said that while the writers could have kept Marissa alive, she thought that her character should definitely have a dark and tragic end. She explained, "I just don’t think sailing off into the sunset’s the proper goodbye. She’s one of those burnout characters where I don’t know how much more we could have done with her anyway," according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Rachel Bilson Has Said About A ‘Hart Of Dixie’ Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=for-the-show>For The Show?</h2><p>Creator Josh Schwartz called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa's passing away a "creative decision."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;The Huffington Post, he explained,&nbsp;"It was a hundred percent a creative decision for the show and it was born out of both feeling creatively like it was the direction the show needed to head and also, quite frankly, a function of needing to do something big to shake up the show at the end of that third season to both get the show to come back for a fourth season and, I think, to give the show a real creative jolt in Season 4 and move the show in its own surprising, unexpected direction."</p><p>Schwartz also said that Mischa Barton did a wonderful job portraying her character: he said, "But Mischa showed up every day and did her job and did a great job and worked really hard so it had nothing to do with her."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To ‘O.C.’ Star Willa Holland</a></span></p><p>Fans will remember that when Marissa Cooper died, she and Ryan were driving in a car, and Kevin Volchok was right there, chasing them.

She said, "I’m not really sure what people’s preconceived notions are. I don’t look at the gossip websites – it’s unhealthy and I think it’s a large part of what drives people in LA crazy. I’m an actress, I’m in this to find the next great project.
