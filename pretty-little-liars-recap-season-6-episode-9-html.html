data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-3-0-0@published data-word-count=179>In the universe in which we reside — you readers, the Vultures, and I — there are laws of physics that govern our lives. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. But in the Rosewood universe, this is not so. For in Rosewood, though the first half of an episode may be almost entirely dedicated to the notion that the Liars, for the safety of their fellow students, are not allowed to attend senior prom, the latter half of that same episode sees every Liar, every Liar’s boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, and Sad Robyn, run laps around that very prom from which they were quite dramatically uninvited. A chaperone posted <i>inside </i>the dance recognizes Aria on sight and tells her to make herself scarce voluntarily. Is security or any such backup measure employed to remove Aria and the gang by force? Nope! Are parents called? Not even one! Does anyone in the senior class, any teachers or buzzkill parent chaperones or randos in masks serving fruit punch, acknowledge their presence and panic? This is where I must say: LOL, no.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-3-0-1@published data-word-count=9>Onward to the Pretty Little Power Rankings: Prom Edition!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-4-0-0@published data-word-count=66><b>1. Emily (last episode: 10)</b><br>“Check this out, she’s 85 percent tequila <i>and</i> her dress is on backwards.” Yes, Emily! Also: outstanding eyeliner, perfect hair and crownlike accessory. You know what else I love? Her barely veiled disgust at Aria falling, yet again, for someone whom any human could see was not who he said he was. “You <i>really </i>had no idea?” Oh, Emily. She really didn’t.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-5-0-0@published data-word-count=89><b>2. Drunk Veronica Hastings (last episode: not ranked)</b><br>Chug, chug, chug! Throwing back the red like Tami Taylor downs white, our drunk Veronica Hastings is a queen, burning everyone who ever burned her. “I can’t even spend time out here anymore without being reminded of that <i>woman</i>. That’s where the dog dug her up.” Can it get better? YES, IT CAN: “It wasn’t bad enough that this bitch tried to steal my husband, but her sicko son had to bury her in our backyard! Ten feet away from my lilacs!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-6-0-0@published data-word-count=24>She makes terrible decisions that endanger everyone she was ostensibly protecting, but forgive her: She is a character on <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>, after all.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-7-0-0@published data-word-count=58><b>3. Spencer (last episode: 11)</b><br>Naturally, Spencer dedicated two full weeks to writing a valedictorian address she claims she had no interest in giving, only to be wrecked at the news that she’s persona non graduata at her own commencement. (A rule I’m sure will be as strictly enforced as the one banning Spencer and the Liars from prom.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-8-0-0@published data-word-count=51>Those heels she’s wearing in that first scene at the Brew are soooo good, I don’t even care that it makes zero sense for an 18-year-old girl to own them, let alone wear them for a casual coffee run.

The Hastings’ Barn (last episode: not ranked)</b><br>I’m not going to say that barn is bigger than my apartment. But it’s not <i>not </i>bigger than my apartment. Should I put twinkly lights on my shower curtain?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-10-0-0@published data-word-count=200><b>5. Ali (last episode: 5)</b><br>I love that none of the Liars get why Ali doesn’t care about the prom. In case you have forgotten (as the show seems to forget approximately 87 percent of the time), Ali went missing a full <i>year </i>before this fine series even premiered. If we are being as close to reasonable as possible about the amount of time the rest of the Liars have spent fake-attending Rosewood High and say the start of the series was the start of their freshman year, Ali would have never spent a day as a Rosewood High student until she Buffy-ed back from the dead. Even if we go by another timeline — wherein Ali, <a href=#>as her “Missing” poster indicates</a>, was 15 years old when she was (not really) kidnapped — that would still mean she was only in high school for, max, just the ninth grade. Girl has moved on from high-level, middle-school manipulation (sigh, I miss that version of Ali so much) to making it with hot cops and dressing like she folded down the corners of every page in a Land’s End catalogue. She hopscotched right over the high-school experience; obviously she doesn’t need the prom!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-00ee8cb89009fd4482403d2cd8289ea7-11-0-0@published data-word-count=26>Great Belle dress, though.

Caleb (last episode: not ranked)</b><br>Does Caleb get a haircut every time he’s not in an episode? Also: that suit? Noooo. He’s not wearing a tie, he’s got this crazy wide collar like it’s 1977, and is that an ascot, or a patterned shirt underneath his white button-down in case he needs to shed a layer?

Aria (last episode: 9)</b><br>I would be remiss if I did not tip my hat to the best line Aria has had all season, and perhaps the truest line anyone in Rosewood has e’er uttered, as she explains to her mother why it wouldn’t be a problem to fill the prom with police: “It’s fairy-tale theme. They can go as the village idiots.” I know you and I play by the same Gchat rules, where “lol” means “amused silence” and only a caps-locked “HAHAHAHA” indicates actual laughter.
