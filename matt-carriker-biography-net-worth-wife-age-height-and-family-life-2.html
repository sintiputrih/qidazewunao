October 21, 1986.&nbsp;Details about the vet, parents and YouTuber’s early life have not been released.&nbsp;Although it is uncertain if Matt has any other siblings, he is known to have a younger sister Ali who is also an aspiring veterinarian.&nbsp;Carriker’s Xacademic records reveal that he holds degrees in Veterinary Medicine and Biomedicine from Texas A&M College and received his license to practice medicine in 2012.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong><span>career</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>He runs an animal clinic at Fair Oaks Ranch, Boerne-based veterinarian Matt Carriker is better known as a YouTuber.&nbsp;He first burst onto the YouTube scene in 2007 with his debut channel, OffTheRanch, dedicated entirely to vlogging his personal life and family.&nbsp;With nearly 2 million subscribers and millions of video views, the channel was a huge hit for Carriker.</span></p><p><span>Again, Matt decided not to be your run-of-the-mill conservative vet but used his initial success online to gain a larger audience.&nbsp;Considering Carriker’s love of documenting his adventures in the woods, he decided to start another YouTube channel in 2011 – “Demolition Ranch”.&nbsp;The popular firearms channel, which shows videos of his gun adventures, currently has no less than 5 million subscribers.</span></p><p><span>In January 2014, Matt created his third channel, Vet Ranch, where he shares videos about his team’s animal rescue efforts.&nbsp;Vet Ranch also has a huge following with millions of subscribers.&nbsp;The channel also has a supplemental website, vetranch.org, which documents and shares the medical stories of homeless animals.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wealth-income-and-earnings></span><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The American YouTuber began his journey to fame in 2007 when he joined the popular internet platform.&nbsp;In addition to the impressive money Carriker makes from his vet clinic, he’s famous for his YouTube channels Demolition Ranch, Vet Ranch, and OffTheRanch.&nbsp;With millions of subscribers to his Demolition Ranch channel, the vet is sure to make money off the internet.&nbsp;Carriker is believed to earn a significant amount of money from regular and long visits to his channel, from ads on his channel, as well as from monthly subscriptions paid for his premium content.</span></p><p><span>There have also been whispers that Carriker may be collaborating with some TV networks to produce animal-related shows, but those reports remain unconfirmed.&nbsp;Matt Carriker has done well as a YouTube star so far.&nbsp;He should be financially stable and lead a comfortable life.&nbsp;His current net worth is estimated at $1.8 million.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=matt-carriker-family-life-%e2%80%93-wife-children></span><strong><span>Matt Carriker Family Life – Wife, Children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Matt Carriker’s significant other and longtime love is Meredith Atkinson.&nbsp;The high school sweethearts have been dating since they were 10th grade.&nbsp;Although their story is about love at first sight, Matt had to wait patiently for the right timing as they were both in different relationships at the time.&nbsp;Luckily, it didn’t take long for them to become one and have been clinging to each other ever since.&nbsp;In 2007, Matt decided to take her relationship with Meredith to the next level, and by July of the next year they were walking down the aisle together.</span></p><p><span>The union of Matt and Meredith gave rise to threechildren: two girls – Adalyn and Annie, and a boy – Abby.&nbsp;Matt is an internet sensation and loves to share precious family moments on social media.&nbsp;But unlike her husband, Meredith is probably quite conservative when it comes to social media outreach and not much is known about her.&nbsp;Carriker’s family also includes his sister Ali and a dog, Dozerman.&nbsp;Matt and Meredith have evidently found love in each other’s arms over the years and so far show no sign of an end in sight.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section
